0,2023-07-11,"The app is good for connecting with friends, family and even potential business partners. However as of recently I've experienced some problems with the messages portion of the app (ex: themes aren't showing up on my end but are present on other person's end). Idk if it has to do with a bug but it happened all of sudden out of nowhere on both of my pages (one private the other public). But besides the occasional bugs and sometimes the app/website being down randomly, I say it's a decent app.",3
1,2023-07-22,"Used to be my favorite social media app, but ""improvements"" have made it harder and harder to use and I find myself using less and less. The most recent terrible ""feature"" added makes the photo carousels autoswipe after 3 seconds. There is no way to turn this off and it is driving me crazy. You are not TikTok - stop trying to be. Also, dark mode breaks down all the time and I find myself in an environment where the background is white with white text, making it impossible to read anything.",2
2,2023-07-25,"Instagram is the best of all the social media. IG is not just a posting platform, it facilitates the processs of getting one's message out to the world. The design functionality of the interface is intuitive and user friendly. It guides me to the best possible options without limiting or directing what I do with my content. No other platform is as responsive or even remotely aware of the unique needs I have. IG knows how to innovate and improve the presentation of complex content.",5
3,2023-07-09,"I love this app.. but as of late, I have been having problems with the screen and background turning white, longer than normal loading, and now it just keeps crashing! If I get a notification I can click and see but the moment I go to home page, it crashes. I uninstalled it, cleared the cache, restarted the phone and nothing works! Please fix the bug in this app.",2
4,2023-07-17,Used to be a great app but there are so many more bugs and issues than ever before. Plus they are ruining their user interface trying to keep up with other social media platforms. Making editing videos in the app extremely infuriating. It's like they try to add all these extra features but don't quite do it in the right way so it actually ends up limiting what you can do. It feels like I'm fighting instagram every time I just want to make a little 15 second reel.,3
5,2023-07-11,The app has been glitching alot. Videos will not play and instead just show a black screen. Audios will not play either. The message themes keep going back to default even once changed they do not stay. I've tried to delete and reinstall and it is still not working. I've done this multiple times as well as restart my phone and nothing has helped. Not working as it should be.,1
6,2023-07-18,"I like this app a lot, but the messaging part of the app is very frustrating. I sometimes won't get notifications when my friends respond to me. One time recently, I sent my friend a reel, and they responded, and then I went to see what they said, and the reel I sent were gone on my end, but they could still see them. Sometimes, I'll send messages, then leave the app, then go back, and it said I never sent the message. Wish the bugs would be fixed because I've dealt with this for a while.",3
7,2023-07-13,"Eventhough sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't. The quality of videos uploaded to the site sucks as well as the recommended videos (Not Video Resolution). There is also a lack of configuration options for your recommendations, like wanting only verified accounts or just being able to manually change your interests, or just the ability to reset your suggestion feed. The way the site is set up can also be confusing. ðto Instagram and Meta for the quality of this app, do better.",2
8,2023-07-14,"I'm not sure what the point of leaving a review will accomplish when the most recent reviews are all regarding the same issues and nothing has been done to address this. I have the same issues, videos, pages, shorts are not fully loading or refreshing, leaving me with black, gray or white screens. If I'm fortunate enough to see a video, short or photos it's the same stuff for days. I hope someone is working on a fix , but by the lack of any response from the developers, users don't matter",1
9,2023-07-13,"This app has so many frustrating aspects. The themes won't work, and when they do it works for 5 minutes then stops. The messages glitch out to where it looks like the messages have been deleted so you refresh the entire page. This happens whenever I open the app. Texting outside of the app hardly works. It doesn't send my messages through there, but when I go into the app it sent it twice. Then the notifications are the most glitchy. They stop until I restart my phone randomly for no reason.",2
10,2023-07-20,"The only complaint i have is about the video calling feature, its too small because it's split screen. Other than that, i love this app and use it daily. Edit 2/13/2022- this app has given me LOTS of issues. It's been twice where i open it and it says ""can't refresh feed."" I've tried uninstalling it and restarting the app but that didn't work. I've also had previous trouble logging in though that seems to be fixed now. I don't know what to do to get it to work. 7/20/23 it's long fixed lol",4
11,2023-07-12,"So a while ago, I noticed that when I talk to people my background keeps getting set back to default colors. I usually talk to my main people, and our background is different than default. But it won't go back, and when I change it the background would either go back to default or it would change but it would only last 1 minute. Please fix this, I've tried reinstalling but it didn't work. My friends said that theirs are normal, so there's something wrong with mine.",3
12,2023-07-09,"Love the app but everytime I open it, after about ten to twenty minutes of scrolling it just stops playing reels, and it is aggravating cause it'll let me scroll and reload stuff, but it will never play it, and it won't let me watch the videos in my saved/stories as well. I've been keeping it updated, I don't understand why it's doing this. Edit: and now it stopped working. Crashes every time I try to get into it.",1
13,2023-07-26,I was fine with all the updates until I watch video posts on the explore page and I HATE that after the clip is done it just moves on to the next post! Esp. if the post has more than one slide it will just move on before I can see the next slide! So Flippin annoying!! Update: now I get this weird black border around all of the videos if I don't tap into it ð¡,2
14,2023-07-11,"Says I've had a msg for a year & none of the troubleshooting ideas work. Annoying, but tolerable. What's not is when I click on a Black content creator tagged in a caption & it won't load at all. Tried many times with several different accts & non-black accts opened just fine. I tried force-stopping, clearing data, uninstall/reinstall, restarting my phone, etc., just to be sure that what I'm seeing is actually what is happening. This seems deliberate & it needs to be corrected immediately.",1
15,2023-07-23,Was better before.. Now the comments are one long line (on mobile devices) whereas before the user could see all the text and proofread it before sending it. It's not always easy to get a point across in one sentence. Please make the UI more user friendly. Also I'm wondering what drives the pictures that come up in the search window? I get many that I have no interest in.,3
16,2023-07-12,"App switches to dark mode and unuseable. For the past few weeks, while using the app, it will switch to dark mode and made text in black background. So the posts are unreadable and the app is pretty much worthless and unuseable. It sounds like this is very common and needs to be addressed. There are too many other platforms out there now for Instagram to be letting this go for this long. And yes, I cleared all caches, reinstalled and the whole works. Several times. âºï¸",1
17,2023-07-10,"Even with light mode on, sometimes the app will turn the text to white on white so I can't read anything. Seems to happen everytime when I click a link in someone's bio and go back to the app. Chat themes also I can't see anymore. Would be good to turn off the autoplay feature since if I'm looking at a photo and there's a reel below, it'll automatically start playing the reel and once the reel is done it'll scroll to the next post even though I'm not done looking at the picture.",1
18,2023-07-10,"Pretty good app, and I use it frequently, but there's been some issues lately. One is the apps weird color scheme changes where the background and posts be a clash of black and white where I can't see texts, another being issues with chat themes. After I close out, it will automatically change back to pre-determined, and it sucks because I can't see the colors that give it a personality",3
19,2023-07-10,"As a Photographer, Web Devloper, and Graphic Designer, it feels very limiting to use Instagram. The aspect ratio is set to 1:1 or 5:4, and the app doesn't respond to landscape mode on the device. Also, the algorithm seems to suppress posts unless you pay to boost them. Of course, we will never know as all of that info is kept secret from the users. It's still a good app for sharing photos and has the potential to reach a larger audience, and it's good to connect with a younger target market.",3
20,2023-07-16,"Easy to use for the most part, good to talk to friends, but I've been having an issue where if I go to the home screen or open another app Instagram doesn't show in my recently used apps and I have to reopen it. It doesn't sound bad, but it's really annoying, and it's only happening with Instagram, even after reinstalling. I haven't found a fix and it's been happening even after a few updates.",4
21,2023-07-09,"The app will NOT open anymore. Any attempts to do so cause it to crash, saying there is a bug. I've done everything to fix it, restart my phone, uninstall and reinstall the app, check for updates both on my phone and the app, cleared cache, all of it. And the app continues to crash whenever I try to open it. I am FORCED to use the web browser, and it's ridiculous.",1
22,2023-07-09,"First, I lose the ability to use reels with no real indication as to why. I upgraded app versions, clear caches, and nothing. Now, I can't even scroll through posts without the app crashing and a pop-up saying that there is a bug that needs to be addressed and to download the new version when developers create a patch. How about I just delete this app and not use any form of social media. Do better.",1
23,2023-06-28,"It's currently impossible to edit reels in the app. They stop playing when you try to edit them, and if you save as a draft and open it again then the ""audio is no longer available"" and deletes from your video. Or, if you accidentally hit the back button, all of your work disappears. The screen also becomes partially white and black at times, making it difficult to read text.",2
24,2023-06-28,"The app is honestly my favorite social medias, and the only one that I reliably use, but there's just so many thing wrong with it that it's hard to recommend it to anyone. There's the fact that the screen will randomly become half light and half dark mode. Or the fact that only some devices get newer content such as notes, chat themes, and most recently the ability to use songs in notes, and I'm also able to use said features on my 2nd account but not the primary one.",3
25,2023-07-09,"Recently updated this app on a pixel 7 pro with the latest July patch. The app now force closes the moment it opens. It opens and disappears. I can reset the device and maybe get it to open if I get a notification from the app. But I would say about 70% of the time it just randomly closes. Incredibly frustrating. Unbelievable. I'm not sure if it is the operating system update or the most recent update on the app, but judging from the dates on some of the reviews I feel like it's the app update",1
26,2023-07-07,"not only has instagram become super annoying to use (reels were a mistake), but story highlights are still broken ð¤ª i know for a fact this is a common mistake and there isnt a fix for it. highlights with music wont load, they freeze. and its not all of them either, just like some random ones. and its not because music was removed either !! the same song will work on one, but not another. idk just fix the app man",1
27,2023-07-12,"Instagram sucks reason 3 and 7, out of way too many... can't turn sound on in people's story. Unless you have turned it on in the feed scroll. Can't start up where you left off, like you can in Twitter. Instagram will throw you to the very latest upload whether you wanted to see it or, not. App is becoming worse and worse. Almost time to delete it like I did with facebook. Videos glitching again.",2
28,2023-07-09,Keeps crashing ever since yesterday. I've tried the web version and it works fine. For no rhyme or reason it just started insta crashing when trying to launch the app. Even went as far as removing the app and reinstalling it but after scrolling for only a couple seconds it kicks me off ://. I might be banned but that wouldn't explain me being able to use the web version. Hopefully this gets fixed soon.,1
29,2023-07-20,"Over personalization and location tracking make this app slow and frustrating to use on a consistent level. Especially while traveling or being outside of your original data coverage area. Having said that, Instagram is a considerable upgrade over Facebook in every way. An absolute huge problem is the constant scamming and soliciting from bots and people alike. Another incredibly large problem amongst the community is identity theft and buying of accounts, specifically on reels.",2
30,2023-05-17,"1. I see more ads than content from the 1200 people I follow. Also they changed back to the ""x weeks ago"" time format which is super inconvenient. 2. You used to be able to hold down on the image when editing and see what it looked like before, but now it moves the image. You have to go into each adjustment to see what it looked like before that adjustment. 3. When it saves the image to my gallery it's not the same image, ie. Theres black bars from straightening showing on the sides. ð¤·ââï¸",1
31,2023-06-14,"Formatting has just gotten worse and worse. When on the explore page, you can't scroll smoothly anymore and it plays random videos underneath or above as if you're watching them, when I'm trying to look at photos or read text-based posts. Super distracting. I don't understand why they're trying to phase out photos when this is literally a photo sharing app. The only thing that works somewhat smoothly is reels, and thats not what i want to use this app for at all. Makes me so frustrated.",1
32,2023-05-22,"Updating my review since many of the issues have been fixed. The ""save"" menu that pops up is a great addition to let us choose which save folder to use, but it'd be nice if it were less prominent. It covers most of the screen, but if I want to quickly save a video and move on without picking a folder, it gets in the way. Maybe a smaller menu would be better.",4
33,2023-06-09,"I'm not sure what's been happening. Seems update after update just causes one bug on top of another. Currently, and for a while now, my stories don't want to load correctly, or in today's case, at all. If I add text or stickers or anything really to one slide in a series, it adds it to every slide. I go through each slide and trash what isn't supposed to be there. Then, go back to the original and pull everything up from the trash area to replace it all. It's frustrating and time-consuming.",2
34,2023-06-18,"In the last couple of weeks, when I am using the app, it will randomly change to either an all white screen with photos or everything other than the photos will be black. When the screen is black, I am unable to see any words, only the photo. Through most of the glitches, I have sometimes found a work-around, not this time. The app too will just start scrolling on its own sometimes, which is really annoying. Please place attention & focus on this issue as well as the other people have mentioned.",3
35,2023-06-11,"This app used to be smooth and functional. But every update seems to introduce new bugs rather than features while keeping the old bugs. Now it's to the point where the app is no longer functional. For example, one specific chat is inaccessible, when I click on it, the app crashes. Another example, when I'm scrolling through reels, after a certain point, I will scroll where the reel says, ""This reel is unavailable"" and the app will immediately crash. These are both broken essential features.",1
36,2023-06-19,"I've never enjoyed this app, though I can appreciate the content on here. It's a decent way for artists to share their art and for others their life. However I do think that it's unreliable. The app is incredibly glitchy, which may just be me, but it's worth a note. Specifically on Instagram, the format will change dramatically whenever you go to a different screen. Ex: The messages could be in light mode, then you exit to the home screen and it's in dark mode. This has only happened recently.",2
37,2023-06-06,"The change into format ... weeks ago instead of the precise date is very inconvenient. Also, after the update, the story icons are too big. While choosing pictures for a post, if you leave the app (for example, to go to the gallery to check the pictures), it automatically resets all the chosen pictures, so you have to choose again. It is unclear how to draft the posts. Also, the draft reels folder keeps appearing and disappearing. There's ads one after another (too often)",3
38,2023-06-11,So many issues. I think every update just messes something else up. I use IG mostly for video chats and all of a sudden I can connect to Bluetooth and I no longer have a full screen of the person I'm talking to nor do they get a full screen of me it's just two half photos on top of each other. Trash. The sound is not the best if you are in a room with anyone else since staying connected to Bluetooth is almost impossible. PLEASE FIX. I would love to go back to normal video calls.,2
39,2023-05-10,"This app really is just throwing itself in the garbage. It pushes reels so hard, but can't get them to work right, so I'll be scrolling them for a while, and when I close the app and click a different one later, the next swipes are same ones I had already seen, in the same exact order. It also tells me when to swipe a reel if I watch the same one a couple of times, as if it's giving me a tutorial on how to use it. Also posting images glitches edits and crops them weird no matter what you do.",1
40,2023-05-25,"Annoying. Has been crashing a lot lately, and freezes. My recently liked posts setting is missing. I used it a lot, but now it's gone. Hoping they'll bring it back. And it won't let me save posts. Edit: And now they've changed it so posts show how many weeks ago, and not an exact date. Also, the messages don't work. Sometimes they'll show up a few days after someone's sent them.",1
41,2023-05-09,"The words ""Something went wrong. Please try again"" haunt me in my sleep. Reels editor is a disaster. I have a fairly new and powerful phone so it's not my device's issue, plus I've seen other reviewers with the same problem. It freezes up as soon as you start doing ANYTHING in it (adding clips, trimming them, music, text, transitions, etc.). With how much money Meta has and how much they push reels in the algorithm, there's no excuse for it to be such a trainwreck!",1
42,2023-06-04,Very disappointed with trying to upload multiple pictures. When I got to edit them it then moves the so that they are no longer centered and are being cut off. So I get part of the picture and then get half an inch of a vertical black line on the left side. It's especially annoying when I've spent so much time adjusting these pictures just to find out they have been shifted and everything I do to fix it doesn't work.. it just goes right back to being cropped...,1
43,2023-06-06,"Since the last update, Instagram story creation has been bugged. Specifically, the layered sticker function isn't working correctly. When you choose a subsequent sticker, it now forgets where you were in your images, so you have to scroll back down from the top (previously, it remembered). Also, if you add a sticker, it copies it onto the story after it when making multiple stories. Overall story resolution seems lower as well, at least when it comes to adding text to video or gifs to text.",1
44,2023-07-09,"Constantly declining. That is the best way I can describe my experience with Instagram. Entire chats being deleted, notifications never going out, themes appearing and disappearing, videos I send or receive often cannot be played (and are corrupted when you download them). There's just so many issues, and that's with just the DMs Sometimes audio keeps playing when I close the app, sometimes the app double posts comments, and sometimes it doesn't let me post at all and I have to start over again",2
45,2023-06-15,"Every update makes the app worse. They take away the good features and keep adding unnecesary stuff. Instagram lost its touch after everything became a reel. It used to be nice to see the pictures my friends posted. Now all I see are random reels, suggested reels, repeated reels and ads. This app lost its ""intimacy"" with the users. Now it feels like an overcrowded concert, something you cant enjoy. Really sad tbh, and I've used the app for more than a decade. It has gotten progressively worse.",1
46,2023-07-26,"a necessary evil :/ unfortunately, a lot of connecting relies on ig nowadays but the app sucks. i have multiple accounts and the app is horrible as a business, creator, artist, or just normal user. basically no matter what kind of account you have the app is terrible and not user friendly. the algorithms suck. reels dont even play half the time. edits from one reel show up on others... u cant just scroll a chronological feed anymore...buttons always move and change. basically tiktok 2.0 ð¤®",1
47,2023-05-20,They just changed the layout for how you share videos/pics with friends. The layout was perfectly fine the way it was before. Now you're gonna make me download a previous version of the App because it's so stupidly changed. I don't like the new layout for sharing videos. I want the share to story option in at the top in a list format like it has been for however long. I don't want the option at the bottom of the screen. I don't need 15 chat heads displayed front and center. Please fix.,1
48,2023-07-09,"The app is full of glitches. The screen turns white and then I can't see anything else. I used to love this app when it was all about fun and beautiful pictures. Then it became all about videos which is really annoying. Now they've made it hard, nearly impossible, to find relevant content. Unless you only want to see content from accounts with huge followings, you're out of luck. They've made it nearly impossible for small accounts to get noticed by taking away the ""recent"" option.",1
49,2023-05-04,"If you share multiple photos with someone, you can't even look through them or save them. It shows them as a stack of photos, but inaccessible. Messaging barely provides notification nor does it refresh itself. I have to go back to my feed and refresh my feed before my messages will refresh. Sometimes a full closing and re-opening of the app is the only way to fix it.",1
50,2023-07-05,"What a piece of junk software. I would love to give zero stars. Whatever they did in the latest ""value added"" update appears to redact every picture and/or post after a refresh. Photos (if they show up at all) are blurred. It won't let me manually refresh, log out or access any user options. The only workaround I found for now - is to delete the app and reinstall each and every time I want to interact with it. If it wasn't a ""free"" data mining sink hole, I'd demand a refund.",1
51,2023-07-22,"Constant story notifications despite having them turned off in the app. I had turned on Instagram notifications for the first time in years relatively recently, but it is incessant. It will not stop sending story notifications every hour or two. Terribly annoying. I'm turning off all notifications once again. Garbage app, it will not allow you to be a casual user, the algorithm wants you addicted. Zero stars.",1
52,2023-07-22,"Too many ads. This app was great before I had to see an advertisement between every set of stories and every 3rd post on my newsfeed. I'm at the point where I report every single one because they show up too often but I'm about ready to stop using this app because I don't see the content of prople I follow. Instead it's all ads, promoted content, and recommended trash",1
53,2023-07-24,"The forced swiping of posts went away for a while, and now it's back for some reason. I really hate this ""feature"", being dictated by the system how long I should look at a photo. I acknowledge I can tap on it to stop the timer before it auto swipes, but that's an extra step when I don't want it to do that to begin with. Please start surfacing options for how I view content and interact with it, please stop forcing me to do it specific ways.",2
54,2023-07-16,"The app has always been glichy but as of late all of my messages are suddenly not showing up like they've been deleted! I've used all of the troubleshooting I've seen, restarting my phone, loging out and back in, checking wifi, switching to data, ect. Nothing has brought them back and now I cannot text my friends on the app anymore, please fix this!",1
55,2023-07-21,"customer service is non-existent. When my last account got hacked, they have a photo-retrieval method in the app that they use to analyze your face and compare it with photos on your account to return it if it matches. Problem was the app would crash during that process on my pretty new android. There's no one to reach out to. I had to start over after years having my previous account.",1
56,2023-07-18,"Would have been a 5, now a 3. For a month or so now when I hit reply to reply to a message it no longer automatically enters the name of who you are replying to. So you have to memorize it, then type it. If that isn't bad enough the sentence/line wrap feature no longer works. The reply just keeps on going on one line forever. Makes editing impossible. I have checked the settings and have yet to find a setting for this. This is only for the last month or so.",3
57,2023-07-04,"In the edit, it be nice to have a borderline frame ð¼ï¸ around the picture so it can keep straight when adjusting the size of a picture. In the preview section it would be nice if display was identical like the display for all to see. It would make it easier to visualize. Before it's sent through the feed. Hope you'll consider it.",3
58,2023-06-07,"Updating: search could be more user friendly, or have filters. No length adjustment for Stories, so they flash past in 1 sec. (it used to at least give me three before this update). Have to add music to add any length to the stories, however music search for stories is awful, 'suggesting' music that is so far out of line with what I would ever use and doesn't update suggestions. If it's going to make suggestions, at least give us a thumbs up/down option.",2
59,2023-06-12,"Good concept, and the photo adjustment tools used to be really good, but somehow don't all work as well as they used to. The app is shockingly buggy, especially when posting multiple adjusted photos in one post. And the same bugs often come and go repeatedly with different updates. I have noticed some eventually getting fixed, but then some new ones always pop up. Also, I want the feed to show mostly the people I follow, not so many new suggestions.",2
60,2023-07-17,"Important to use for modeling. Otherwise I would not use this buggy app. Text disappears from my post for no reason, messages get sent multiple times, and important features are completely missing. For example, once you post, you can't edit carousels (remove or change order), you can't add collaborators, and IG crops images no matter what you do when you can add collaborators before you post. There are more bugs and complaints.",2
61,2023-06-20,The color scheme is constantly turning white and once it's done that your unable to select anything. Conversations with friends is constantly disappearing. Photos I've tried to download become blurry and have to delete. I've restarted my phone several times to try to get it to correct itself to no avail. I'm about ready to just get rid of this app.,1

One of these issues alone would be an issue, but it's many inconveniences that pile on top of each other that are enough.",1
63,2023-07-22,"It's an overall fine app and works, but some features absolutely do not. I try to start a saved posts folder with multiple people and it won't allow me. The feature also isn't available on my separate account, it's like one account is ahead of the other in terms of updates, oh yeah i also uninstalled and reinstalled the app to see if that would fix things and it didn't, i tried on pc also doesn't have the features. It seriously needs some fixing.",3
64,2023-06-06,Full of glitches. You have to make reels to get traffic and the reels feature has so many issues I'm about done with the whole app. I just lost an hour's work on a reel with no warning. The whole reel is just gone. Not in drafts. Not posting. Just gone. This kind of thing keeps happening. It's not worth the headache imo.,1
65,2023-06-13,"REELS Icon disappears on me almost daily. Un-installed & re-installed pretty much daily for over a month. I've contacted support 2 times with no response. My phone, internet, and app are all up to date and running fast, I just constantly lose my reels icon and the ability to scroll through the reels I can see. I have to either find reels on stories and back out to my home screen after watching every reel or un & re install the app. What is happening? So frustrating!",1
66,2023-07-24,"The recent update made it so hard to do anything that you would originally get the app for: posting photos and stories, and instead replaces all of the convenient buttons with shopping and reels, which no one wanted.

Now my profile looks off because the video cuts from zoomed in to normal.] If you send multiple photos to someone, then it appears in a stack that can't even be opened. You have to refresh constantly to see new messages. On the explore page, it has an auto scroll that can't be turned off so you have to fight the auto scroll to even consume content.",1

Accidentally touching the top of the screen causes the app to scroll all the way to the top, which is STUPID. Add a refresh button we can actually SEE. Any time you use the ""share"" button, you risk losing your place because the app refreshes itself. Also, Instagram and Facebook have a special ""app installer,"" which I hate.",1

The only thing I'm able to currently post onto my story is anything from my camera roll. I've tried updating it to the current update, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, and logging in and out of the account as well. Hopefully I'm not the only one dealing with this issue currently.",3
70,2023-05-12,I agree with most of the negative reviews. Right now I can't share ANYTHING to my story. Posting multiple photos of different sizes at the same time is a nightmare... IG will just decide to randomly crop whatever it wants. The reels editor / reels remix is a joke and I don't even bother anymore... always freezing or posting with errors after it looked fine in draft. You'd think these would be easy issues to address and they would make them a priority ??? Super frustrating.,2

It no longer gives me the option for ""original posts"" with the most recent update. Instead, it is ""save original photos."" I turned it off and on again several times. Still saves posts to my camera roll. I don't need multiple copies of the same photo on my phone. It just clutters up space that I need. 1 star until this is fixed.",1

The first is the worst, you wont get a message at all and it will send later & vise versa as you could send a msg and it disappears, but reappears later.

This can result in a frustrating user experience, as you end up either dealing with bugs, or unannounced changes to the UI make you wonder if there's an issue with your app until you figure out the new processes yourself. It'd be preferable if all changes were consistently announced via pop-ups, as some already are.",4

92,2023-06-24,I'm a small artist in the app and I love how we can connect as a community. However the app screws us small creators over. The new update makes hashtags virtually inaccessible and makes it almost impossible to find small accounts. Also the algorithm only boosts reels.

It has been ignoring the users who speak up against the changes for a long time.",1

I changed the theme to another one cuz the default looks plain. And every time I get out of Instagram and go back in, the theme is gone and it resetted back to default.

Sometimes it randomly turns into light mode and I have to close it and open again. Sometimes it simply doesn't either let me send images or open them, so I have to keep uninstalling all the time.

It tries to manipulate users by changing placement of buttons and not giving users an option to disable notifications (threads and broadcast channels).

Not very user friendly.",1

I'm not sure though, but insta users in my circle including me, have the same prbs: some messages don't show as soon as a user receives them. If I open a link from insta and close it everything gets messed up (the theme for exemple). Some users are able to use the reply to message feature but others don't (I can't). I think there is also emojis other than the heart, that can be used in other OS (I can't). My OS is Android. Thank u",3

493,2023-07-11,"The deactivating of accounts randomly was one bug that was yet to be fixed and there rises another bug regarding themes. Whatever theme is being kept in the dm it keeps redirecting back to the default theme for no reason, it's more like you are just unable to change the theme at will and continue keeping it because within a period of a day or two it's changing back to default on it's own.",1
494,2023-07-10,"Constantly buggy. Will receive several messages in a conversation (seen thru notifications) and it will only display one. Force closing does nothing. Clearing cache broke the app so all I see now is an empty app. No content, nothing. Uninstalling. Embarrassing that such a huge corporation has such a bad product.",1

There is enough space in my phone, all other apps are working smoothly, I've updated and reinstalled this app multiple times, but this app isn't seeming to cooperate with me, Please resolve this!",1
497,2023-07-15,"Every patch makes it buggier. I no longer receive notifications for dms and it constantly removes the post and send button so I can no longer do anything. Edit: App is still garbage in 2023. Algorithms make it where no one sees your post unless youre just talking about the same ""Trending"" garbage. Basic features are barely functional, if they are functional at all. Pretty good job so far.",1

499,2023-07-22,"I can't report scam accounts because the person they are pretending to be does not show up. I have multiple cases where I've tried to report accounts for impersonating influencers and the like, but for some reason, I couldn't select the influencer's account in the drop-down menu. I type in the account username that is being impersonated but nothing shows up. If I remove the last letter of the username, a drop-down menu appears but none of the options is the account I want to put in.",3
