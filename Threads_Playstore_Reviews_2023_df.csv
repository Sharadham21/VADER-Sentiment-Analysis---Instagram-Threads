0,2023-07-08,"Meh. Not the greatest experience on a Chromebook. Seems to be customized for phones only. Opens in a little screen that you can't expand or resize - for reasons that are a complete mystery to me. Judging from the fact that every other app I know of is resizeable, this seems like it was a conscious choice by the developers . Why you'd do something like this is beyond understanding and suggests a control freak approach. Not a great way to make a first impression.",2
1,2023-07-19,Pretty good for a first launch!! Its easy to use and self-explanatory and I'd say the algorithm is good as well. It has great *potential* but a few things need improvement: -the ability to use hashtags would make it easier to find topics and people you'd be interested in -an option for a following-only feed would be a major improvement (especially chronological order) -the ability to choose images from albums rather than recent photos -the ability to save photos to phone,3
2,2023-07-06,"For a brand new app, it's very well optimized. However it's just missing quite a few features that apps like Twitter have. There is no way to have your timeline show threads from who you're following. It would also be nice to be able to switch accounts quickly like on Insta. I've also noticed that videos have a hard time playing audio sometimes. Overall, it's a decent first version that I hope will get more features as time goes on. I'll up my rating once the things I mentioned are addressed.",3
3,2023-07-10,"Great app with a lot of potential! However, there is a lot that needs to be fixed. For example, the option to mute accounts is lagging/delayed. This feature is definitely needed at this stage, which is part of the next problem. Another issue I've noticed is the home page shows a lot of accounts I don't follow and have never heard of, and a lot of blue check accounts that I don't want to see. There is no way to filter them out to see the content I actually want, from people I follow.",3
4,2023-07-06,"The app is good, but it needs a lot of functionality. For example, when searching a topic, you don't find anything related to that topic, meaning anything that comes to you is via your main page, which incase lowers a lot of outreach and possibility of finding content that relates to you. Hashtags could called Threads and make it easier to find topics and such. Needs lots of work. It can be a good app, but it feels rushed.",3
5,2023-07-18,"Currently, it's very challenging to use. It's in dark mode and I want to change it to brighten it up. But apparently I can only change it through Instagram? Why? Dark mode needs to be improved. It's tough on the eyes and the UI is visually unbearable. Twitter nearly perfected the UI. I think it's a decent start but I can't use it for more than a couple of seconds even if I wanted to.",2
6,2023-07-19,"I still donât want to see content from people that I donât specifically follow unless I explicitly search for it. And when I do search, I want to see an option for complete searches and not just user searches. This is a bare-bones poor clone of Twitter that seemingly is just getting some initial traction due to political bias. No thanks - fix it. Also, if you donât provide a web desktop option to use the service, itâs a double whammy.",1
7,2023-07-06,"Could be great if all pages loaded when you clicked on them. Sometimes they just don't. Posts usually don't load at all. And my biggest thing: if you follow someone on Threads, you automatically follow them on Instagram as well. Either they're two separate apps or they're not. I would really like to be able to have a different list of people I follow on each app.",2
8,2023-07-09,"I'm liking the concept! There is room for improvement though. Everytime I try to attach a photo to a thread, the app crashes. I haven't been able to add a photo at all. I also can't seem to find a way to view a list of only the people I follow. There's always other folks mixed in the list. Finally, I can't seem to edit my posts. I make a lot of typos! I can edit my posts on Facebook and Insta but not here? Weird.",3
9,2023-07-06,"Not bad! This is its first launch. There is still room for improvements... I would like to see a trending page, longer videos, and an edit button for any threads(posts) uploaded by the user. Improve the loading time. Add a pause button(and slow motion controls for videos). A quality selection on videos(1080p, 720p, 480p, etc).",5
10,2023-07-09,"Over all, the UI of this app is good. Using it is easy and visually it is very clean. Unfortunately, it fails in the functionality department. My home feed is 99% random people and not the accounts I actually follow which defeats the purpose of following someone in the first place. I recommend having the home feed be just the posts from people I follow and a separate discover/search page that will show new accounts who post similar content to those I follow.",2
11,2023-07-07,"Nice but crashed & can't access photo folders. It crashed twice today so far in the middle of browsing. Also, for some reason, when I click the file button to attach a photo, it doesn't let me browse individual folders in my gallery...it shows my whole gallery which is inconvenient. Everything else is pretty okay and I expect it to get even better. Although another issue Meta should fix is that it shouldn't delete your Instagram if you decide to delete Threads lol please undo that.",3
12,2023-07-14,"Pointless in following anyone. The feed algo won't show you the content you actually follow and want to see. I find myself opening this app wanting to like it but quickly get annoyed by seeing randomness. It's like you're invited to a party all your friends are at. Then you get there and it's nothing but strangers all trying to have incoherent, disjointed conversations with you at the same time. It's more stressful and annoying than engaging.",1
13,2023-07-06,"Not quite ready for prime time. Needs a feed specifically for accounts you follow. If you have more than one Instagram account, Threads doesn't allow easy switching between accounts without involving logging out/logging in/security confirmation. This shouldn't need to be repeated over and over. Also, it is concerning that the app is blocked in the EU due to privacy violations. Use at your own risk.",2
14,2023-07-08,"Very frustrating experience. Feed it's full of users I don't follow and don't care for their content. Switching between my company and private accounts forces you to complete sign out and reverify. Picture upload quality is compressed, Twitter images are much sharper. I am hopeful for this app, but it should have never been released as a finished product in it's current state.",2
15,2023-07-06,"I like the simplicity of this app but there's definitely some bugs that need to get worked out. After choosing to sync with IG accounts I follow I weeded through them but about 1/3 that I unfollowed reappeared. I've done this 3x, closing out app to refresh, it keeps happening. Also, home page is super slow to refresh and posting a thread or reply is very slow to publish & sometimes freezes. Also wish that when trying to post a pic/video that one's device folders would appear & not just Gallery.",3
16,2023-07-14,"It needs a lot of work. It constantly crashes, to the point where I can barely use it. It isn't auto-following everyone I follow on insta. I can't search for terms, which lead me to a topic I'm interested in and the layout feels quite lacking. It needs some sort of visual flare: animations, pops of colour, page transitions, etc... just something to make it all feel pleasing and tie it into a great package.",2
17,2023-07-06,"My first thoughts: Since there is no web version yet, it is very difficult when using it upright on a tablet. But I'm going to try it on a few phones today and I'm sure it will work fine. If the web version comes, it will really be more useful than I expected. The leaks of this app first appeared in April, which means it could only release stable later this year, but when they wanted to turn the troubles on Twitter into an opportunity, they released the app with many missing features.",3
18,2023-07-06,"It's cool, but there's a lot of QoL that can be done. Like putting the ""Post"" button at the top of the posting menu. Also, there's a bug where when you mention someone, if you type two letters of their name before the suggestions appear, the app crashes. I think the app has potential, but needs some polish. Also, kinda wish there was an option to make an account from scratch rather than import an Instagram account.",3
19,2023-07-14,"It's great, but there's a lot of QoL that can be done. Like putting the ""Publish"" button at the top of the post menu. Also, there is a bug where when you mention someone, if you type two letters of their name before the suggestions appear, the app crashes. I think the app has potential, but it needs some polishing. Also, I wish there was an option to create an account from scratch instead of importing an Instagram account.",3
20,2023-07-07,"I find the UI does not clearly separate the messages and particularly which messages are part of a conversation. I have also found the app gets stuck updating and randomly crashes. It would also be useful if when I block someone, they are also muted rather then having to select both. I have had to remove a lot of people and companies I don't want in my timeline.",2
21,2023-07-06,"Firstly, I want to express my appreciation for the overall concept of Threads. It provides a convenient and private platform for sharing updates, photos, and videos with close friends. However, the integration of the Reels feature within the app has caused some inconvenience and cluttered the user experience.Separating the Reels section within the app would greatly enhance the user experience. It would allow for improved focus, easier navigation, enhanced privacy, and a streamlined interface.",5
22,2023-07-07,"It's not bad so far. A handful of unsolicited requests, but they're easy to despatch of. Clean feel and just seems nice and neat around the edges. It's like a flowing conversation. As a moderate social media user, it does everything I need it to for the type of app it is. Some sound and freezing issues with some videos I have viewed, though I am sure they'll iron these things out over the next couple of months",4
23,2023-07-07,It's a good start but they have to add some thing before it can be great: 1. They need to add an option to see only people you follow instead of an annoying algorithm. 2. They need to let you mute all posts from languages you don't want or not know. 3. They also need to add option to change the name without changing the Instagram name. 4. Another useful think would be the ability to zoom on an image and staying zoomed without it snapping back to normal size. 5. They need a website.,3
24,2023-07-09,"Constant crashing when trying to upload most photos, although there doesn't seem to be a pattern of image size or resolution, which causes it to crash or simply fail to upload. I have, however, been able to upload images up to 44MP, 33MB successfully uploaded. Would like the option to clear the random rubbish from my feed without having to keep muting them!",1
25,2023-07-06,"The app's concept is great, but it's full of glitches! Whenever the content in the display changes, the full app becomes glitchy. Even on a small scroll, the problem appears. Let alone some button clicking! Maybe the issue is only applicable for a few type of users. But, please fix the bug. In spite of this app's being great, I have to stay neutral by giving 3 stars is just because of these bugs.",3
26,2023-07-06,"I'm still wary of this app. But it's very promising. I love the interface design though there's still room for improvement. I personally experience lags while scrolling and I find that hard to navigate when the app keeps doing that. I also think it's better to implement the new emojis on the app but as well for instagram, too. Creating an account is a hassle if you just want to make a fandom one. And I find it a hassle to go to another app just to change my display name. I hope that'll change.",3
27,2023-07-07,"Very easy to use because it's just like Twitter. But I'm starting to hate it because Instagram's best traits are being removed. Reactions for chats, and music for stories? Might as well just remove this app threads. Instagram is being loved through posting pictures but it is very convenient for having conversations with reactions if you don't know what to say. Music for stories is also important to express oneself. I just hope the effect on the Instagram app is just temporary.",2
28,2023-07-06,"As soon as I opened the app, it went good, the login and all, but as soon as it loaded, I could not even use this app because it started acting so weird, like a bug or smth. All pages are overlapping on each other, I can't even interact with anything because as soon I do, the page starts to behave like a bug. Even reinstalling didn't help fix this issue",1
29,2023-07-11,"Great App! Loved it from the very first day although I have the following challenges; 1. My keyboard does not stack with the UI page, it covers it and so I can't see what I'm typing. 2. Can't save images like every other user. 3. From 100+, Can't see the latest follower as an individual to see their profile; have to search. 4. UI gets a little confusing sometimes as there's no proper demarcation between one thread on my timeline and another. 5. Opening some threads crashes the app occasionally.",4
30,2023-07-15,"It suddenly closes. I thought I just accidentally hit my home button but no. I was typing but overtime, it suddenly closes. There was even no draft of the text I was composing. Happened multiple times. I just updated this app and thought that it would fix the issue, but no. This is also the reason why I stopped using this the last time, I got frustrated because it kept refreshing(?) or closing and the thread I was composing is not even saved.",2
31,2023-07-07,"This is clearly a very early and poorly tested version of the app that was pushed out to cash in at the right time. First, the app crashes a LOT. Simply opening certain people's threads closes the app every time, but works perfectly on other threads. This is pretty much a deal breaker. Second, I think it's fair to say a web version or desktop app should have been available from the beginning. The fact that it's missing just means it's all a side effect of rushing out this new platform.",2
32,2023-07-07,"It's addicting but feels cramped and messy because there are unnecessary elements like showing the profiles in replies, but it depicts friendliness, so it's good. And I feel like the elements are too close to each other. The app is great because there is no ads, spam, and free from toxic, yet. I hope they can keep the environment safe and toxic free.",4
33,2023-07-11,"I don't normally write reviews but I'm so annoyed with this app! I've tried to share a picture about 10 times, both by sharing from my gallery and directly uploading to the app and it's not working. I've tried updating the app and when that didn't work, uninstalling and reinstalling. I'm at a loss. Very frustrating.",1
34,2023-07-09,"I think it is great but some features needs to be advanced. First the photo loading time is still slow, secondly I suggest that all Meta Apps could be synced inform of tab/browser where you can switch platforms easly. For example if you are in threads you can have switcheable icons or tabs to navigate to Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and vice versa. Fourthly, there should be filters through which people could determine thematic areas of interest including themes, topics, personalities, etc",3
35,2023-07-09,"There's an annoying glitch that makes this app almost useless, whenever I change tab, such as from activity to feed or profile, their UI overlays on top of each other which makes reading anything is Impossible. I had to minimize and reopen the app in order to make the glitch gone, but only temporarily because the same issue will reappear if I try to change tab again. Please fix this!",1
36,2023-07-20,"The application doesn't work and constantly says 'Sorry, something went wrong. Try Again'. This is frustrating. I tried to clean cache and data, reinstall, different internet and wifi connections, with and without vpn, but nothing works. I truly want to use it, but I can't. :( Fix it, please.",1
37,2023-07-06,"Interesting App, but somehow the user experience is kinda less user-friendly when already has a lot of users. The threads are mixed up, and it would be great if there is a setting option for an account owner only who can see the ""Replies"" tab instead of showing it publicly (without changing it into a private account). And somehow when I try to modify the settings and navigate back, it always redirects to Instagram App instead, not navigating back to the Threads app.",3
38,2023-07-22,The lack of options when it come to seeing unwanted content you are not following is annoying. If I like certain things the app will bombard me with a bunch of similar content that I'm really not interested in. I try with this app but it got more and more frustrated as I keep on using it. I really wish there was an option to block certain things in my timeline not just in replies.,2
39,2023-07-09,"Missing most basic yet most-desired features like saving media! It's intended to replace Twitter but lacks a simple save function for images and videos. People like to SHARE and people like to SAVE media. Every single person on the planet knows and understands this. It cannot and will NEVER replace Twitter as long as it is missing a feature everyone wants, period.",2
40,2023-07-07,"So at the moment I have two issues with the app: the first is the feed - there needs to be an option for follow-only feed on something like that, something closer to the Instagram experience. The second issue is the crashes - I know this app is literally two days old but it crashed on me a few times already and it sucks. Other than that, works fine, nice app.",3
41,2023-07-06,"Yes, the app is excellent. My experience with this app has been fantastic. I know it's a new challenge for Twitter. Here are my suggestions for the next update: 1. I highly recommend adding a scheduling feature. This would be incredibly useful for creators like me to plan and schedule their Threads in advance. 2. Another suggestion is to incorporate a direct messaging (DM) feature. This would enable users to have private conversations within the app.",4
42,2023-07-13,Great start for a positive space. Like many reviews so far there are things to add to the app to make it better. The search page is a bit bland maybe more like insta? A visual thing. Trending would be good on there too. And instead of the usual drab news stories why not the best most positive news stories circulating. The no ads is a winner for me though that will probably change. I have to say it is a breath of fresh air so far. But it needs to stay a positive place.,3
43,2023-07-06,"1-we need a trending list for every region, just like Twitter. So that people can know what's going around the world. 2-when posting pics or videos, it doesn't give us the option to choose from different folders like Twitter does. 3-when typing a long reply, the view doesn't automatically adjust to show what we're typing. Instead, we have to scroll up to see the rest of what we're typing.",3
44,2023-07-08,Really needs a lot of improvement. It's a promising app. Hope you can fix the bugs. Add options to filter what we want to see in our home page. Add DM. Option to add more than one account just like in IG. It's frustrating to go back and forth. Oh well... Hope this app will improve.,2
45,2023-07-07,"Very messy to use, filled with threads from irrelevant people, despite the data collection that meta has on all their apps which include health and fitness for some reason. This makes it extremely boring to use, as the algorithm doesn't appear to be able to show any of my interests that it has collected from instagram - seeing as the two apps share the same account. It would be better as part of the instagram app, such as reels, as a section inside there.",1
46,2023-07-09,"Update: Threads cannot handle dark mode, and it is automatic. so after 9 p.m. it is impossible to use, at least on Android 9 ------- more than half the time, threads shows a garbled mess of letters on an Android phone. also, threads has no means to report this it sure would be nice if they had some sort of feature to send a picture and show them what it looks like, or simply have a way to message or report an app issue",1
47,2023-07-07,"off to a great start. Obviously it's never gonna be a 5* app upon release, but so far my only gripe is that features which are planned for inclusion aren't there yet. Look forward to when this becomes a more rounded, 'complete' software product. Also, ability to save images would be nice.",3
48,2023-07-11,"There's a glitch in the app. Pages are overlapping. Tries every possible aspect to resolve the issue by re-installing, clearing cache & data but still unable to use the application properly. Very disappointing. Finally, uninstalled the application as for now. Whenever the app will improve, will download it again. Till then using that old Twitter.",1
49,2023-07-07,"It's a good app and has more restrictions than what Twitter has to offer, but after I transferred my Instagram data, I hadn't been able to open up my Instagram. When I do open, I can only stay on chats that I have been notified in, and if I navigated away from the chat, it crashes on me. I've uninstalled it for a little while, but it still doesn't work. I don't know if it's a thread thing, an Instagram thing, or both, but it started when I downloaded Thread.",3
50,2023-07-08,"as of now, i've experienced a few bugs depending on which device i use threads on. on my tablet, everytime i try to post my art the entire app crashes. on my phone, everytime i try to post more than one photo the post reads something along the lines of ""post couldnt be uploaded"". although i do have hope for threads, its very simplistic and easy to use.",3
51,2023-07-08,"The data collection on this app is SINISTER. The user agreement has the same function as Facebook where they literally own your images and content, and can use it commercially. Now I can't delete it without deleting my instagram! If you are an artist, avoid this app at all costs. Everyone else, go into your phone data alloance settings and turn off all data allowances for the app. It won't stop the data mining but it might help. Very dangerous for user security.",1
52,2023-07-06,"The first day on the app has been really good- I haven't noticed any bad bugs or experienced any crashes. Please add a following-only feed and an option to view in chronological order. That would make the app so much better. Pretty please ð Since this is competing with a certain bird app, a trending page with current events/etc would be really nice and appreciated!",5
53,2023-07-12,"I was excited for the app but once it is loaded, I could not even use this app because it started acting weird. All pages are overlapping each other. I can't even interact with anything because as soon as I do, the page starts to behave like a bug. I tried to reinstall but it didn't fix the issue.",1
54,2023-07-12,"This version would be decent if we were talking about a beta, but it is the final version and it lacks many QoL improvements. There is no option to see only the threads of people you follow in chronological order, can't use hashtags, the algorithm doesn't take into account the profiles you follow or interact with and recommends anything, cannot perform keyword searches, some videos don't play audio, and many more bugs and non-existing options that should have been there in the first place.",2
55,2023-07-21,"Slow, glitchy, and constant crashes! Whenever we try to post something it always ends up in the limbo, garbage experience! Update: no basic features even after month of launching, and glitches and slowness is still same, can't upload anything because it ends up in the limbo, no wonder why this app is losing the game against twitter.",1
56,2023-07-13,"Very buggy, initially after getting it, it took over 60 hours before any content showed whatsoever on my feed, despite me following many people and my partner having loads on her feed. Recently, it took me about 48 hours to upload something on it while Instagram and other apps worked perfectly fine. Multiple attempts occurred both on wifi and on mobile data with no results. It'd be really cool if the bugs could get sprayed down some more, maybe get Daxter on it.",2
57,2023-07-08,"Such a frustrating buggy experience. Looks promising for us photographers. No apparent restrictions on image size, crop or quality. But I cannot get it to load from within the app or share from my Pixel 7 folders. Weirdly it has just allowed me to post one image from my White border app. ð¤· Of the thousands of images I have to share it literally will only let me share this one image. Plus I experimented with sharing it again but the app refused and just closes. ð¤¦",1
58,2023-07-10,"Well I installed the app out of curiosity and it seems interesting but whenever I open the app, it's all glitch. I'm unable to see a single word perfectly and everything is just messed up on screen. Hope you resolve such bugs and issues soon and be able to provide a great user experience.",1
59,2023-07-15,"Its just not working. It was fine for a while but something happened and now whenever I try to check my notifications or write something, it says ""sorry something went wrong"". Tried reinstalling, didn't help, it's simply just broken. I was already disappointed in this half-baked trash that lacks even the most basic functions like hashtags, but at my current state, I'm unable to do anything but refresh the timeline which is filled with unfunny meme accounts and verified scum. Unusable. Zuck lost.",1
60,2023-07-07,"For now, only 3 stars! Can see potential in this app, but agree with some about a few improvements. I'd like to see 2 FEEDS! One the current random FEED... to view everything that's happening and connect with new people. And a 2nd FEED (maybe a TAB), that shows the people you already FOLLOW, showing their POSTs... making it quick'n simple at a glance to see what friends are doing. We don't all have time to browse content of a random FEED for POSTs made by those we choose to FOLLOW.",3
61,2023-07-08,"Just got the app, tried three times to make a post, and it failed each time. Tried different formats, low character counts, etc. and all in perfect service. It just failed to post. Maybe I'll come back when the app is actually usable.",1
62,2023-07-10,Starting was good like login and editing the bio. But after that when I opened the app to see what type of features and contents it contain. It started glitching and always it acts weird. Didn't expected this type of bad work from Meta. The application needs a lot of development. Looks like it's a launch without trial. Very disappoint. Want to delete my Threads a/c but for that Instagram a/c also will be deleted because thats the algo. Dissatisfied and Disappointed.,1
63,2023-07-07,"As a starter this is okay but there are two deal breakers. One is the feed. You get stuff from accounts you don't follow and have no interest in and it cannot be changed. Second, if you log in with instagram, you can't change anything or deactivate profile on threads as it's synced. You have to change or just delete your entire instagram profile.",2
64,2023-07-09,"- The UI is a bit clunky. Icons have really thick outlines that heavily compete with text visually. Lines between threads are too thin. - Video players are quite horrible. Sometimes audio never works, sometimes the video perpetually pauses on fullscreen / when tapping the thread. - Most threads I see are from accounts I don't follow. While I think that's good for discovering new accounts upon first launch, I don't see many threads from followed accounts.",3
65,2023-07-06,"Continually running into a message, ""Sorry, something went wrong. Try Again,"" on every page. It happened last night and I tried clearing cache, forcing stop, logging in and out. Only thing that fixed it was uninstall/reinstall. And now the same error is happening again. I don't want to have to reinstall this app every few hours.",3
66,2023-07-09,"I think it's a decent start. Some features I think would be important going forward, though; the ability to search topics and tags rather than just people. To go along with this, the ability to follow specific topics would do much for the ability to curate a homepage. Also, having an in-app direct messaging system would do much to improve the experience. Other than that, and the fact that this app is still in its infancy, I can see a good potential for Threads as a platform.",4
67,2023-07-16,"The app is going well and nice, easy to use, and friendly. But I recommend a delete, edit,and save option. A Delete option to be able to clean the activity or notification. To be able to edit a message or picture to add a caption when it's already posted, and a save and bookmark option. I personally need the delete option, I can't help but get anxiety when my activity is messy. I tried checking a post notification of an activist, but it swarmed up my activity history. Please add options.",4
68,2023-07-06,"It's a good app. You can share anything, especially your current thoughts and whatnots. However, I suggest that there should be a choice of interests too so that the contents on home will be filtered with that interest. It will be much more fun to use it if people see what they actually like to see. Hoping for the improvement of algorithms.",4
69,2023-07-12,Not a bad app (it runs smoothly and interfaces well with Instagram) but definitely could be improved. The home page is flooded with completely untailored posts that have nothing to do with any of the accounts I follow. Without tags it is hard to find new accounts to follow based on what I am interest unless the keyword is in their username.,2
70,2023-07-06,"Right now, it's a void. Very little of what you actually want to see shows up, and the rest is noise from bigger accounts (verified army) and ads. We'll see what it becomes eventually (your following does creep through every now and then, but not nearly enough). I do think the UI is clean though.",2

Other than that, this app has been great so far to browse. I really want to like this app, just fix the posting experience please.",2
72,2023-07-21,"I liked the app a lot, but since a week ago it doesn't work properly on my device, and I get a message ""something went wrong"" whenever I try to view a profile, comments or activities.

73,2023-07-06,"(Notably I am the 1st person to REVIEW this app in English). Apperantly it's USELESS APP... it has Good dark interface, but there are numerous issues ð it crashes often without error message, too slow to even update profile section, Can't even upload single image (despite there is with high speed broadband connection), copy paste doesn't work .. ""@"" function (in bio) doesn't work .. not sure if all these issues will get resolved. Otherwise I am going to uninstall it and stop using for forever.",1
74,2023-07-06,"While I do think the app has some potential, there are several problems. Some of them include the lack of photo filters when you upload photos, the inability to delete your Threads account without your Instagram account, the inability to use more than one account, and the app crashing several times when I log out, leading myself to delete data and cache rather frequently. I wish this app wasn't released prematurely and that Instagram gives more time to develop Threads as a more stable app.",2
75,2023-07-06,"Signed up for my other account via Instagram. Spent time setting up. Tried to post 3 times but every time I pressed the 'post' button after writing the post & adding images - it closed! Not impressed. Only using as I need to be across all social media but really not happy with my user experience on the first day of it going live, & don't like you have to tie it to the Instagram. I'd prefer it to be a standalone platform, it feels like you're being forced to put all your eggs in the Meta basket!",1
76,2023-07-08,"The idea behind this app is great! It's quite convenient that it's connected to Insta account. However, experience with it can be improved. Majorly, by changing algorithms of feed to only view Threads of accounts you follow, or by adding a feature to filter your feed manually, to choose whose threads to see. Hope this feedback will be taken into account ððð",3
77,2023-07-18,"10/10 for the UI, it looks cool and clean. But the feed is just infested with suggested content. At least on twitter you can separate the suggested content from the content of entities that you actually choose to follow. Might have some interest in Threads if they implement this feature, but for now... Bai",3
78,2023-07-07,"It's pretty much Facebook's version of Twitter. Unfortunately the app is unstable and lacks basic features find in its parents app, like switching accounts. Whenever I open ""threads"" (replies to a post within the app) the app will crash every other time. It's quite embarrassing to have the main feature bugged. The app is an unoriginal idea and it needs significant improvements. If it worked, could sort feed, switch accounts, and post audio, I'd give 4â­ I'm using Oxygen OS 13.1 (OnePlus 10 Pro)",2
79,2023-07-23,"This app's fatal flaw is it's feed. Almost everytime I go on Threads, my feed is entirely made up of random people I do not follow and do not care about meaning I'll turn off the app almost immediately. This entire app would be saved by splitting the tabs into a following and a discovery one. Right now, it's not worth it.",2
80,2023-07-09,"Good for early days, a bit glitchy and lots to build on still. In the middle of writing a post, the app closes down entirely and looses the content so I'm having to write it in my phone notes. If you write a long post, your phone keyboard is in the way as the Threads text box doesn't shift up the more you write, so you can't amend mistakes or text. I'm seeing a heck of a lot of posts from people I don't follow at all and have no interest in. A familiar, simple app though so I like it so far.",3
81,2023-07-07,"Terrible in terms of privacy and lacking many essential features, such as a timeline for just those you follow. By using this (and other Meta apps too) you are giving away basically almost everything about you to a company with a horrible track record when it comes to properly handling user data. Try Mastodon instead, it's onboarding process has really improved recently and it has far more features.",1
82,2023-07-06,"there's some flaws I've noticed . 1. Reply in thread goes far way bottom, not the below of the thread that meant to be replied 2. Text cursor doesn't follow my typing, need to scroll by myself if it's a long thread 3. I can't save images 4. can't 2x tap to zoom image, I must pinch it to zoom and it's doesn't stay still zooming the image, it always goes back to original size. 5. Video UI/UX is not very interactive and intuitive, can't tell the duration 6. No media bar in profile 7. No hastags",3
83,2023-07-07,"So, immediate problems: The way to choose files is unsortable and awful. Writing replies to ANY post is frustrating because the keyboard will cover it. Curating your feed is difficult at best and impossible at worst, since at first it only shows verified account's postsâ except you literally can't search for topics you enjoy to interact with those and curate your algorithm. I really hope it gets better.",2
84,2023-07-17,"Going on two weeks since public launch now and this app is starting to suffer from lack of very common features (which honestly should have been standard at launch). No ability to filter your feed or search posts/tags. Account follower import seems to be messy for those with a larger following.

FYI, It happened in Andriod mobile app when I first wanted to post a new thread. I want you to fix this bug very soon.",2
86,2023-07-23,"Worthless so far. I have no idea what the feed is doing. It's not showing me any of the accounts that I follow, and the rare one I do see the post is 20 hours old. There's no way to sort by suggested, followed, most recent, personal lists, anything. There's no hashtags, no way to really search for the content I want to follow. Hurry up and get on adding more features to make this thing functional.",1
87,2023-07-12,"A great start, but it needs lots of improvements. Only being able to see posts by followers on your feed for one, an option to edit pictures and videos before you post them, it's also common for the app to crash while trying to upload pictures and videos.",3
88,2023-07-07,"With a multitude of auto-playing videos right off the fly of the homepage, it's really difficult to focus on the ""Threads"" that're meant to be the defining feature of this platform. This is basically just Instagram, but with a higher character limit. The unnecessarily large size followed by the lack of data saving features makes this app pretty redundant considering the existence of Twitter.",2
89,2023-07-11,"Impossible to use. It gets loaded with pics and text layered on each other infinite number of times and my whole screen turns into a mess. Guess it is not optimized or something. This is the only app that gives me such an issue, and Instagram itself works fine.",1
90,2023-07-08,"The app looks promising and at its initial stage that's why there are some complicated parts of it but I do suggest some features such as, messaging feature just like in Instagram; photo cropping and editing feature when posting a picture; circles would also be good; and lastly, ability to look at someone's profile picture. Overall, the app was nice and already makes some people an online friends within just few days of launch",4
91,2023-07-08,"So far I like it! It's very basic and I'm kinda disappointed at the lack of accessibility options such as being able to add alt text but... Overall it has a nostalgic vibe like when social media used to be fun, at least it is for me. Interested to see how it progresses.",4
92,2023-07-07,I've seen a lot of people had the same experience as me. But I'm gonna repeat it so someday it can be fixed. I CAN'T USE IT. Anytime i decide to simply scroll the screen the app explodes into clones of all the things on screen and nothing is visible anymore. PLEASE. LISTEN TO US.,1
93,2023-07-08,Should've launched a stable version. Full of bugs and glitches. Characters overlapping each other while scrolling through making it impossible to figure out. Thorough inspection required. Issues to be fixed at the earliest. Re-installation was futile.,1
94,2023-07-06,"Off to a great start! This is a great alternative to other text-based social media! After installing I could import my Instagram profile pic, bio and followed accounts (some of whom are already on the new app).

My only suggestion is I would like to see a more compact timeline UI or the ability to customize the size of posts so I can read more Threads per screen ð",5

I know that they will be adding it, but the home page doesn't show who I'm following half the time and instead is showing other people I have little to no interest in. As well as this, the lack of tags seems to be a problem if it's not added soon. Other then that, a very good start and already better then Twitter.",3
100,2023-07-08,"It's decent, but it definitely needs a few interface improvements. Hasn't crashed or anything, which is nice. However, a huge problem is that my entire feed is taken up by people I don't follow or have any interest in despite being logged in. Makes it completely useless",3

I want to manually select who of my Insta followers to follow in Threads, and twice now I've spent a fair while going through the list only to have it shut down when I get to the end before I can continue to the next stage.

107,2023-07-12,"has lots of potential! people are complaining that its missing aome basic features, which it is. but they were mostly focusing on making sure the app runs smoothly, which it does. has almost completely replaced taitter for me already and with some good quality of life upgrades it can be much better than twitter",4
108,2023-07-07,"So far, so good. I like the layout and ease of use. And that any follower from IG that uses it automatically follows you. Choosing which image I want to post could be better. Instead of showing me ALL my photos, let me pick the folder to look it up. That's really my only complaint",4
109,2023-07-07,"Worse than twitter in nearly every respect. When the hype dies down, everyone will be back on twitter in a week. Also keeps crashing every time when I click replies now.

The ability to not see re-threads (turn off retweets), ability to download photos, and If you really want to pass up Twitter, Let us edit our posts after they've been posted... Maybe add a ""Close friends"" sorting option as well like with Instagram.",4
111,2023-07-08,"A good first step but many bugs still needing to be fixed. The most egregious is that the on screen keyboard overlays the input area so you can't see what you're typing. Since this is what I would consider a major bug, I'm rating this app accordingly.",2

I hope this feedback reaches you and serves as inspiration to address this matter. Thank you.",2
115,2023-07-07,"Has potential but also has some issues. So I can see this platform becoming very fun to use in the future but it has some glaring issues.

116,2023-07-19,"So far it's pretty peaceful. I appreciate that there's a pop up telling me that I might be posting something that could be deemed a problem(even if they're wrong), instead of the way FB will just arbitrarily ban me.

123,2023-07-14,"The idea of the app is fun. It feels like a safe space where people are sharing thoughts and ideas. There are a few bugs, sit crashes often and it has slowed down IG as well. But it's a new app. I'm not expecting perfection yet since it was only launched a week ago.",4
124,2023-07-09,The app is still new and I have installed the app for the first time. The setup was easy to do. One thing that I would love to see on the app is that you can upload videos on Threads and the other thing is that you can delete your profile and data because I have read that the only way to delete the data is to delete your Instagram account which I don't like because it's going to upset people when they want to delete their threads data.,4
125,2023-07-19,"Excellent. The UI was clean and the navigations were easy. There was few minor bugs encountered. The app was stable and the experience was seamless. Very easy to reach out to connections and people. Very similar its competitor, twitter.",4

129,2023-07-23,A Twitter clone that is in internal closed alpha stage. The app sucks big time. Lacks on features and polish. Recommender algorithm straight up sucks. It almost feels like non existent. I guess it wasnt something meta invested in wholeheartedly. Also the biggest bummer is the Instagram mindset of the users. People can't be forced to morph into the forum like UX it provides. Absolutely no reason to switch from Twitter or Mastodon. Also no data transparency.,1
130,2023-07-21,"Its cool but here are some issues i see. First off you have no hashtags, you cant search topics, no dm feature, you cant add a backdrop picture. First week you could share a link and the thumbnail would show. Today it only show the link in preview and then minimizes to just the link when posted....something people are less likely to click on. Some people are not dealing with that issue. Cant claim you have an app that will allow more EXSPOSURE and things like that are missing or glitching out.",2
131,2023-07-08,Very clean app with user-friendly interface. But there are things that still needs to be fixed. There should be a place to turn off automatic video playing. And there should be a place to add multiple accounts using Facebook format.,3

I don't want to see boring celebrity thoughts that are boosted just cuz they're ~verified~, I want to see my friends' art. Hoping you make some updates so I can give this one a better review later, but for how it is now I most likely won't end up using it.",2

Way to go Meta. 4) Ability to translate from one language to another. 5) Videos don't have sounds in the owner's profile. 6) When commenting on a picture, you can't see what you are trying.",4

150,2023-07-06,"Well, lemme admit that it has such a good ui, & ux as well... although the real challenge for now is the algorithm, its random rn, obviously its new... but i hope it'll be improved in next versions. The design team did such a great work. We would love to have a quick demo of design system published on Figma, or Instagram design. Best of luck.",5
151,2023-07-07,"for an app that feels like it's in beta, it's decent enough. should be way more polished. I have found bugs in media uploading, already widely reported, but also in the titulary threads feature. sometimes duplicate posts show up if u delete something and repost it. other than that, it's a bit empty, needs voice clips, and a button to DM ppl",3
152,2023-07-08,"So far so good. I know a new app will take multiple updated to implement all the changes needed, so I will give it time to let us choose folders and albums we want to post media from. Otherwise, it's a really easy to use app.",5
153,2023-07-06,"It's alright for now,but let's see how it goes after the perfect algorithm kicks in and some features added. Would love it if u can seperate each tweet/ thread more clearly cuz it feels a bit""compact"" and not ""comfy"" and better search too. Looking forward to how it goes.",4
154,2023-07-06,"There are no reviews yet? Anyways, it's down on my end right now. Few suggestions: explore and trending (or ""threadsetters"") tab, edit button, likes and media tab, ability to save photos and videos, user generated alt text on photos, tagging users on photos/videos, cover photo, location tagging, and zooming/viewing of profile photos",4
155,2023-07-10,"Cannot save pictures & crashes posting pics! Twitter allows you to save any picture; Threads blocks downloads. On Twitter, I can easily post a picture; Threads crashes if I try to post a picture. Ridiculous! So far, this has been a pretty miserable app! I hope they fix it soon.",2
156,2023-07-11,It's good but has a few kinks. It needs settings like an in-app dark mode instead of it being tied to my phones settings. Along with features like direct messaging. Ads don't seem too intrusive but I'd like to see more in my feed from people I follow,4
157,2023-07-06,"No Dark mode, by far the biggest crime No way to create an account inside the app, you have to have an already existing account No desktop version, for an app like this to thrive it gotta have that Upon logging in you are stuck in an infinite loading loop on the main page, only once you close and open the app again does it properly load The attach icon could be moved to the side instead of under the reply so I don't need to scroll each time I wanna attach a photo Fix this ASAP, till then have 1",1
158,2023-07-08,"Threads has definitely grown on me, the algorithm has also gotten drastically better for me which helps a lot. It's only little problems I have with the app now. Wish there was an option to hide reposts from people I follow. Really wish we could pinch and zoom on images; and wish videos would unmute when opened. Otherwise, this is a tremendous first release. It seems to accomplish the goal of Twitter's For You page well and in a way that is enjoyable to use.",4
159,2023-07-07,"The Thread app is a fantastic tool for staying organized and connected with your friends, family, and colleagues. With its sleek and intuitive interface, it provides a seamless messaging experience that keeps conversations focused and clutter-free. One of the standout features of the Thread app is its unique threading system. It allows you to create separate threads within a conversation, making it easy",4
160,2023-07-06,"The app as a platform is great, besides the interface and stuff... but one only issue is that scrolling is low smooth plus I would like to suggest some ways to make Threads go incredibly stylish, such as the like button animation and the app's icon color matching for android 13+ However it's an excellent app that's looking to be perfect, thank you Marks crew ð",4

162,2023-07-09,"I dont know what happened but as soon as I log in into threads, its kind of a bug or something, my screen suddenly starts acting weird and the title and post begins to flicker. I reinstalled it many times but didn't worked. I can't even read a thing.",1
163,2023-07-09,"This feels like a beta version of an app. Was rolled out way too soon with the hopes of cashing in on the temporary Twitter rate limit issue. The app is a mess right now - no following tab, no way to turn off reposts from followers, no search button for topics, TL not in chronological order, no way to save pictures, no GIFs, no DMs, no Trending topics. Will never replace Twitter if these issues aren't fixed.",1
164,2023-07-07,"I understand it just released, but there's a lot to improve. Some things I think should be fixed/added: the option to search for tags or words; too many accounts I don't follow on my tl; chat system; stories; show the quotes for threads; allow us to select from gallery folders when selecting pics to post Edit: new issue, the app keeps closing whenever I try to post something",2
165,2023-07-06,Can't post 50mp photos in the app. The app crashes upon upload to a thread. But the standard sized photos seem to work fine. Would love to see more discovery options like using hashtags etc. I'm sure more things are in the works. The app works pretty fluid on my S23U. Nice!,4
166,2023-07-06,"Great app, but I think 2 issues have to be fixed,, First, it's gonna be better if the pictures/photos are downloadable, Second, when writing using 2 languages like Arabic & English in one thread, the order of the text gets messed up, so for a socialmedia where writing threads is the thing, I believe fixing this issue is necessary. Overall, creating this platform and this app is a great idea.",4
167,2023-07-06,I've only been using it for a day but so far so good. Feedback: the ability to save photos and post/reply with gifs. There's also no option to go through my folders in my gallery so when I pull up my gallery it's just all my photos and no way to access the different folders. The ability to sort the feed from either top or latest,4

Aside form this bug, the app is great, nice and simple. I enjoyed Twitter a lot before. I'm curious to see how the Threads vs Twitter fight goes.",3
169,2023-07-08,"The application works fine without problems, but there is a very noticeable minus there is no transfer in Threads, and you need to make two buttons, the first recommendation, the second on which you are subscribed, this is my personal opinion, otherwise 4 stars, I hope the developers will notice this, and by the way, me too programmer",4

As highly anticipated app and I'm glad this feature were to exist as part of Instagram but as soon I'm finished with getting started I'm met with all screen bug (flashing, misplaced repeated jittered clones of everything everywhere) I'd wish I could send an internal feedback on it with attachments but can't due to bugs. // device info: Android version: Android 9 (FuntouchOS_9.1) Software version: PD1930CF_EX_A_1.18.0",1

It could use a few tweaks and adjustments especially the ability to edit your thread and better audio support for videos as well as gif insertion, also a timeline just for the people you follow would be great too, but otherwise it's solid.",3
172,2023-07-10,"I like the concept, and it's good to start. However, it needs to be easier to follow people in your feed without opening the post and harder to highlight text. I kept accidentally highlighting while scrolling and clicking on posts when trying to follow someone.",3
173,2023-07-15,Overall I love the app. However.... I have not been able to follow new people or follow back any of my new followers for over 3 days now and I can not get anyone to help with this issue. Ive even tried to become verified but guess what can't do that either. This is very very frustrating!!!!! 3 stars because of this issue could be 5 if someone from support could help me out.** 5 days now so I'm going to start dropping the stars.,2

Not just typing blindly.. ,,,while using the app replying a post with a photo media the media blocks your view and you can't see what you are typing ... Plus the post button should be easily accessible.. Work on interacting with your users that's why your notification is there.

This is the same as the ad riddle Instagram platform but worse at this point in time. If you could filter by only people you follow, MAYBE this would salvageable. But as it is now this isn't worth using over Instagram or any other service. There's little to no functionality and it's not even close to chronological.",1
176,2023-07-07,"App with Limited Login Options I recently tried out an app that caught my interest due to its promising features and positive reviews. However, my experience quickly turned sour when I realized that the app did not allow login with a Google ID. This limitation significantly hindered my ability to conveniently access the app and affected my overall user experience. One of the main advantages of using Google login is the convenience it offers. With just a few taps, I can seamlessly access.",1
177,2023-07-10,"Overall, the app is good. Its performance is great for it being initial release. A few suggestions: -Ability to only see followed accounts on timeline -Trending page -Cover photo -Dark mode Pros: -My system font works on this app, while it doesn't work on other similar apps.",4
178,2023-07-07,"Seemed like a great new alternative at first, but it still has Instagram's garbage moderation and is constantly crashing on me.

I will see one or two posts from people I follow before there's an endless stream of influencer and celebrity thoughts that I don't follow or care about. I tried it for a day and will not be using it again unless there are major changes and way more memes.",1
182,2023-07-08,"it's on a good start to be a good socmed app, i just have some problems with it: 1. there is only a for you page, you have to see what the algorithm wants you to see and there's no way to only see posts from accounts you follow. 2. it could he more clear with the data it's taking. simply saying ""other data"" when explaining what data meta takes from us is not transparent. 3. the search section sucks, there is no trending page, no hashtags, and you can only search for accounts",2
183,2023-07-07,"It functions almost exactly like Instagram except worse in the way that your feed is literally no one you follow, just a bunch of suggested people. There seems to be little to no option to toggle that, which at *least* IG does. Also come up with a more fun and silly name for resharing posts the way ""retweet"" exists? ""Reposting"" is a completely different concept. Like the right-click save + reupload kind. That would add like a modicum of personality, at least :/",1

ORIGINAL REVIEW: The app runs fine, but I can't check out my account's Following list, as well as other accounts Following lists either to follow accounts I recognize from other platforms (the same Following list error/glitch has been happening on Instagram, too). Hopefully this error/glitch will be addressed soon in a future app update.",5

I dunno how to explain it, but I posted a screenshot of my experience with it on dammit.bekah though I think it's just a me problem.",2
191,2023-07-09,"The app is very messy, there's a strange effect where I see every post as an afterimage, smeared across the screen. I look forward to seeing what the app is like, after the issue is resolved",1
192,2023-07-08,"This app surprisingly is a lot like Twitter minus a lot of the negative stuff. But it's clean sleek you. I really shows you how little there is to do on either platform. You can't direct message anybody, it's even hard to see what my friends are actually saying. My whole feed is a bunch of people I've never met, I don't follow, and no one's reposting it that I follow. Overall a solid experience compared to Twitter but somehow this app makes you realize how boring it is.",2

I've turned push notifs on for multiple accounts, I've seen that they've posted multiple times now, and I never got a notification for any of those posts. Second: I don't like that the feed shows so many people that I don't follow",3
195,2023-07-15,"It's pretty glitchy, not going to lie. I'm going to uninstall it for now because it keeps saying ""Sorry, something went wrong. Try again later"" no matter what i did, it just would not work, so I can't even use it anyways, what the point of using up storage space. I like the idea though, it's just too early. Maybe I'll reinstall it in a couple weeks? A month? 2 months? How long do you think it takes to get all the glitches out?",3

198,2023-07-22,Not perfect but could be great if they begin minor improvements like hashtags and more comprehensive search. Runs really smooth and UI is clean and simple. Hopefully it doesn't get too bloated and busy like Instagram. A lot better than the cess pool that is Twitter.,5

The timeline, if that's what it's called, needs to show stuff from who I follow, not everyone. I'll check the replies for those comments. Need a dark mode option and ability to make fonts BIGGER and maybe a bold option as well. Also a definite need is when you open the app or refresh the thread, don't go all the way to the top.

212,2023-07-07,There are way too many random people on my timeline. The algorithm is terrible because they don't even appear on my Instagram. They are not related to anything I interact with. I'd prefer it if the default tab were to be for mutuals only.,2

I can't see what I type. g) a DM feature should be added. h) App settings made independent.",2

I have only used it for a day but inability to properly search by topics makes me feel like I see posts which are irrelevant to me than the posts which I can relate to.

233,2023-07-12,Love it so far but it needs improvement. It really needs hashtags. And I hate that celebs and business' are what you mainly see. I wanna see the smaller people. I want to be able to find artist. And I want a way to share my post to people who would be interested in it rather than hopeing a stranger likes it. The algorithm is working but it could use improvement.,3

It's still in the early stages, and more features are being created as it's used, but so far, the experience has been great, and the community is supportive, positive, and helpful.

289,2023-07-13,"A welcome option to get away from Twitter, but migration, though painless, comes without a few much needed aspects. Searching by keywords for posts about a subject can't be done. No option to see trending subjects either. And the app does not always keep its last position, resulting sometimes in restarting from the very beginning of your feed. The recent update fixed the jerky scrolling; everything else is pending more updates!",3

Boring interface, no option for what's shown in our feed, no explore or trending page, even no hashtags. The moderation system works though, and the filters are good unlike twitter where it's way less moderated there. But overall twitter is still a better app in my opinion.",3

301,2023-07-07,For now I give it 2 stars since the app interface just acting weirdly. Looks like the screen is gllitching all the time whenever I tried to scroll. Maybe because it's quite new app. Hopefully it got fixed soon. It's annoying to not be able to do anything.,2

I'm very disappointed. Shall delete my Instagram too.,1
304,2023-07-06,"It's interesting so far, but a lot of us use desktop way more than mobile apps. It took a long time for Instagram to figure that out, but they finally gave a half-assed desktop version. Threads ought to do the same. Maybe even full-assed.

314,2023-07-08,"Not bad app, it does have less features than twitter (like polls and desktop site), but more stuff is probably going to be added one day. I'm just happy that people can (kinda) see my threads without having to pay a subscription. Though, I have a few annoyances. Like paid verification. That's Twitter's thing. I get that it has the ID stuff but still, can you at least make it where if you have alot of followers you can get verified without the fee??",4
315,2023-07-09,It's a good app for spending some of your time without losing the track of time and waste more time like in Instagram and YouTube. It is starting so it is not perfect I think it should have reel s and all plus it should have personalized content because a lot of content I see on thread I don't even care about so they could improve this with updates. It is smooth and not laggy like Twitter with which it is competing. But privacy is a problem because meta is not good privacy,4
316,2023-07-07,"Only one account? So much for businesses being able to use it. It's 2023, you would think that this feature would be one of the first things added. Frustrating to say the least and am really not interested in trying this app anymore now that I realized that I can't have my business/fan pages on here and easily switch between them like Facebook/Instagram/YouTube/Twitter all have.",1
317,2023-07-08,"It was good at first but when I came on the app today it kept on crashing even when I cleared its cache. Please fix it. Edit: It seems like my problem has been fixed for now. As I said, the app is great, missing some features like search but other than that it's pretty good.",4
318,2023-07-08,"Looks very clumsy. Material design sucks. While trying to upload the media, unable to go to a specific folder in gallery app in Android. But works well in iOS. And no option to save images like Twitter. Why that specific option is not copied from Twitter?",1
319,2023-07-10,"I think the Threads app is not bad for a starting point, although it does tend to crash frequently in the background, but that could be attributed to its early development stage. I believe it will have impressive progress in the future.",4
320,2023-07-07,"It's a good start, but it could be better. Please fix how the bell notifications work. They don't really notify me when a person uploads. And please add hastags and a better way to see posts from people I follow. I barely see anything from people I follow. Also add a way to see reposts and a person's posts separately on their account. It looks kinda cluttered",2

322,2023-07-06,It's only just launched so I think we should give it a chance to grow but there's virtually no customization. You can't limit your feed to only accounts you follow and you can't create or filter your own feed via hashtags or keywords. This makes for a very bland and homogenized platform. The feed feels disorganized and strewn together with things I don't care about and don't find interesting. I would much prefer something that could be configured and adjusted to my own tastes.,3
323,2023-07-11,"Worst experience ð­ð, i have installed threads just now and its being really like threads ð, the app has some bugs to be fixed. As i opened the app i the posts weren't clear and were over lapping each other, creating a mess on my screen. It needs to be fixed as early as possible.",1
324,2023-07-11,"The thread app is good app as I heard from my friends.but when I installed and opened the app,it's is something coming like it's having a bug on that.i think meta can rectify that types of errors and not only for me,i saw many of the review that they are also having some bug while opening it, hence meta want to rectify as soon as possible.",1
325,2023-07-07,"Quick, yes. I will need to be able to curate my feed at some point, but this initial flood of content is a goldmine for businesses! Threads Links from other apps (WhatsApp) don't open to the app. Rather, they open in Chrome! Loss of traffic.",4
326,2023-07-07,"The app is very interesting and I personally really like it. I hope that more new features will be added in the future. Similarly, it would be better if there was a facility to save posts and apply hashtags.I also really like the colors used for the app. Already this application has exceeded a large number of users. So, I believe that in the future this will be a very secure, reliable, indispensable application for people.",4
327,2023-07-08,"It's Good but I feel like it's going to need a little more to compete with Twitter. For example This app also needs a trending page similar to Twitter. You could also include something else that is original. I feel like it could have a little bit more to it. I know it just came out a couple days ago, but there needs to be something added if this is going to keep the hype up around the app.",4
328,2023-07-10,"It's clearly rolled out in a haste, but I appreciate the people who worked on this app. There is no method to add more than one profiles which we can toggle between on Instagram. So if we have 2 profiles on Instagram u can only use one. Hope this will be resolved soon.",3
329,2023-07-07,"So far so good. Seems to be working out some bugs, I keep getting kick out the app whenever I try to respond to comments. My phone also provided a pop-up stating that it has bugs. So I'm hoping that works itself out bc I really do enjoy it.",3
330,2023-07-07,"Best and worst Twitter replacement. Interface is very fluid, intuitive and esthetically pleasing, but it keeps crashing frequently. Also, this is an extention of Meta's attempt at monopoly.",3
331,2023-07-07,"Clean and Nice UI . I like it so far , but there are some points need to be fixed . 1- i follow Arabic and English content in my account, but the alignment is bad , if put the app language is English, the Arabic content will be a chaos and vice versa . 2- waiting for the follow and hashtags features, I'm ready to give it 5 stars after these points fixed .",3
332,2023-07-06,i think the app is a great start! one of the things that will be required in order to give space to fan accounts though is to have us be able to easily switch accounts in Threads. You can only sign in/sign out every time - we can't do it smoothly.,3
333,2023-07-08,"3 stars for now. It may go up or down depending on future updates. I love that it's, so far, ad free, that it's easy to use and not as toxic as twitter(although I fully expect that to change). As simple as twitter. Imo, it needs an option to only see posts from those you follow, also a topic or group section where we can join current trending topics or interests we have, which is also a great way to follow others and pick up followers who are like-minded.",3
334,2023-07-08,I like it so far. The only feature I need is the ability to select photos from different albums in my phone instead of showing all photos in reverse chronological order.,4
335,2023-07-07,"My honest review, is that how it is and the idea they have of the app is perfect, following threads and about conversation. I don't think it needs DMs, and Livestream. ITS FOR CONVERSATION AND SHARING IDEAS ONLY. EASY PEACY. Cause what's the point of adding more things, it's gonna get like twitter in the future or later on instagram. I mean, there are already apps for that, let's separate things. I do agree that it could have an option of seeing feed from everyone and another of followers.",4
336,2023-07-20,"Love the app ... One thing I would like is the volume on the videos being easier to select as on .. and once it's on for one, stays on for all until I turn it off. Also, I know they have more to come like better search features. Oh, and if I could see more of who I follow on my feed, rather than your 'suggestions' ... That would be nice ð If you are Threads development reading this, I'm using Android,... Oh and GIFs. I have to use an app, save them and post them rather th. The keyboard on my ð±",5
337,2023-07-11,"I'm grateful that someone has created an alternative to the mess that Twitter has become, and Threads is looking promising. It's early days yet, so I expect changes, but the App desperately needs the ability to show Threads from people I subscribe to, and in chronological order of their posts. The interface is clear-ish but definitely needs work. No ads yet! Unfortunately, I've been followed by 'Sexy Susan' who has zero followers and a risque profile pic so I think the bots are active already.",4
338,2023-07-07,"Any time I scroll it blasts me with visual bugs out the walls to the point where it is blatantly unusable. The entire screen flashes, text leaves constant flashing after images when I scroll, changing tabs leaves a massive collage of broken symbols and images.",1
339,2023-07-17,"Needs a lot of work. Most of the time I can't see threads nor notifications, I always get a something went wrong message. The scroll is too slow. No indication if someone is following you or not.",1
340,2023-07-13,"Another phenomenal socmed platform by Meta! I just downloaded this yesterday and I am already comfortable with using it. The user interface is super easy to learn and get used to. Plus, the features are superb. You can literally upload Threads in one click. Furthermore, you can also reply to other people's post with text, image, and other interactions. They're all visible in one place, unlike to the other confusing and dizzying platform called Twitter. <3 LOL",5
341,2023-07-10,"It's a great app and it's really easy to navigate but there's still a lot to be done.. Add a Message Button, Add Tags in Search, Add in settings where one can disable or enable Public Replies, that should be private. Thanks",4
342,2023-07-07,"As soon as got logged in on the app the entire thing is an unusable glitchy mess. I can't even see my screen, it's just pixels tearing in every direction. I'm guessing it hasn't even come close to being optimized for every device yet.",1
343,2023-07-09,"I would really like it more if I could curate my feed. Facebook, insta, tumblr, reddit, are all positive experiences because I am able to customize my feed experience to my interests. I don't necessarily mind seeing things I didn't intentionally follow, but it should allow me to choose. I'm also really not interested in the inanity of those with massive followings. I much prefer actual conversations with people who aren't here To Produce Content.",2
344,2023-07-10,"It's a new app, and I believe it still needs improvement. While typing, the keyboard covers the text, which makes it hard to see what someone is typing. Also, I think it make a lot of sense of I can see people that follows me on their profile.",3
345,2023-07-09,"Honestly, it really does feel like Twitter, but less cursed. I've seen no real problems with it so far. One thing I think would be cool is instead of showing the little character at the bottom right of the screen to view our profile, it should be our profile picture. Not nitpicking, I just think that'd be a cool idea. Also being able to edit our comments and stuff would be cool as well. Still an amazing app, five stars well earned thus far.",5
346,2023-07-09,"There is no editing tools. It is not possible to select some other folders while posting images, it is fixed to Gallery. Not clear view of threads. Maybe all later will come with some price on them :)))",2
347,2023-07-11,"I genuinely like the Threads app. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of some features i feel the app needs. Trending topics should have been there from the premiere. Also DMs, even if it's a button that links us to Instagram DM to complete the conversation. The app could also use the Spaces function. Overall, Threads is amazing.",4
348,2023-07-09,"Here's my honest review: It's not a bad app, but there could be more features alike that could make the whole app more fun to use. Much like how Instagram allows you to switch accounts, maybe Threads could use the same feature. The only method to switching is by logging out currently. What I liked the most was the dark theme that it came with upon opening the app. Easy to get used to.",4
349,2023-07-06,"Not a very stable application as of me typing, for example when I tag someone or type too much on my device, it crashes. A recommendation for the application is to have an option to pin our threads and the option to edit our threads. It will increase user experience.",3
350,2023-07-17,"Evidently a rushed app to fill the gap left by twitter but it honestly does provide a better experience, if somewhat barenones. All it needs is a few feed options and that's kinda it. It shouldn't strive to do everything but instead focus in on text based content",5
351,2023-07-07,Greetings and blessings to the developer team the app is really good and the ideology is great some people might not love it but it's good. But ... I'm repeatedly facing an issue of not being able to login on insta and threads at the same time so i cannot repost my threads post on insta. This may be a bug but it's a big one and pretty much capable of irritating the user. I'd love if you fixed it.,2

354,2023-07-12,"All you 1stars, give it time. It's a fresh app that isn't trying to do it all. Lead devs interact with users and have explained what's to come. It's fine if you want the X Corp app where every feature breaks on launch but much of what you want is coming - personalized TL, search, etc. Don't get me wrong Meta is sinister but they know how to build an app.",4
355,2023-07-23,"I am enjoying using threads. I only wish I could tailor the post that appear on my homescreen to be more about what I like. Also, wish I could schedule or save posts I'm making for later. Also, I think it would be cool if you could try to make some widgets to be used on the homescreen of phones. Currently not having any luck of being noticed at all on the platform. Please make it easier somehow for smaller threads users to get noticed.",4
356,2023-07-07,"App seems cool. But I would like to search topics and see more of the people I'm following. Also sometimes when I click on my following list, I get a "" Sorry Couldn't complete request, try again later"" Can you fix that.",4
357,2023-07-08,"It works fine as a twitter substitute so far, but every time I try to upload images in my replies, I keep getting error messages saying that my post failed to upload. Yes, I cleared my cache and tried again. The problem still persists.",2

I post some of my insta things from my laptop. PLEASE do the same for Threads. ""Moving to Threads cause Twitter is dead.""",4
360,2023-07-08,Add a better search engine. Add hashtags. Add a better way to share from the gallery albums..instead of one picture at a time. Add ability to customize profile pages with different colors and fonts. Just a few suggestions that would really help.,1
361,2023-07-06,"Good interface but function not as good as twitter. I have a few suggestions: 1. Dark mode option. 2. Can change username even if linked to Instagram. 3. ""Back"" button should close the app directly. Why scroll back all the way to the top before closing? I wouldn't be able to continue where I left off, it's inconvenient. 4.

363,2023-07-07,"Makes me sign up for an Instagram account, but doesn't give the option within the app. Then it tells me my IP address is an open proxy, tells me check their help, which has nothing about it. Like I'm jumping through hoops so they can steal all my data.",1

366,2023-07-06,"Threads features a clean and intuitive interface that is easy to navigate. The app's design is minimalistic, placing the focus on conversations and ensuring a distraction-free experience. From the moment I started using Threads, I found it effortless to locate and engage in conversations.",5
367,2023-07-09,"A great app given the fact it's only been a few days since it launched but there are obviously some flaws into it. For example, when I want to post a picture, it often kicks me out of the app and takes hours for it to allow me to post that picture. I also usually can't see who just started following me, shows me my followers fine at first but once I surpass 50-ish followers, I stop receiving notifications and I can no longer see the usernames of those who follow me.",3
368,2023-07-07,"Loads of improvements can happen. Picture attachments have only ""Gallery"" and do not support folders. I have a load of trash on my Home feed from random users I don't follow. Needs a followers/for you separation in that case. Also, dark mode.",3

373,2023-07-09,"For an app that just launched a few days ago, it's honestly pretty good!! However, there are a few things I'd like to see improved & made: hashtags, folder to save threads, draft notes.",4
374,2023-07-11,"Firstly, I want to express my appreciation for the overall concept of Threads. It provides a convenient and private platform for sharing updates, photos, and videos with close friends. However, the integration of the Reels feature within the app has caused some inconvenience and cluttered the user experience.Separating the Reels section within the app would greatly enhance the user experience. It would allow for improved focus, easier navigation, enhanced privacy, and a streamlined interface",5
375,2023-07-07,"1. Although no ads in threads, but too much algorithmic content on feed which I don't really like. 2. You have to login with your Instagram account. You cannot create new account by email or phone number. 3. Once you created threads account you cannot delete it. If you want to delete, then you have to delete your Instagram account as well because threads account is interlinked with Instagram. 4. There is nothing new UI & UX. Looks like Twitter. Almost same UI. 5. No Chat option. No Hashtag",1
376,2023-07-07,"The home page needs a huge adjustment. There's no logic to the content I'm seeing. There needs to be a way to cater what you're seeing. I only want to see the people I follow, that's why I follow them. It's a mess. Additionally, there's essentially no data privacy, so be weary. Also....you can't delete your account? What a misstep.",1
377,2023-07-09,"Yes, it's a new app. But Meta is not exactly an indie developer! There is literally no reason to be flooding us with Rando Accounts. That should have been basic functionality from Day 1. But like Instagram, seems Threads just wants to push random posts on us whether we like it or not. Until basic functions are in, I'll be sticking with Twitter.",2
378,2023-07-17,"""Something went wrong please try again"". Get this message all the time. Can't see replies, my profile and many other features. This message just pops up all the time. Also people I follow don't show up at the top of my feed. I get random recommendations at top. Back to Twitter until sorted.",1
379,2023-07-06,You cannot delete it unless you delete your instagram account too. The deep integration with instagram is perverse. It could have been a standalone app that does not require you to plug in into the metaverse by force but I guess that was asking too much.,3
380,2023-07-06,"If there was less random stuff on feed, it would be a lot better, or if there was some way to organize it where you have a following feed and a for you feed. There's just too much random stuff.",2
381,2023-07-11,"Its wonderful it's just needs a little bit more improvement, like multiple pictures the second time you post because I posted multiple pictures the first time and now I'm unable to post more pictures including just one but I am able to upload videos which I think is weird I am also able to make regular posts with words only",4
382,2023-07-06,"Threads is a fantastic new app that enhances the Instagram experience and revolutionizes private messaging.

Also, it would be better if we are able to download the video or the picture directly. I personally feel that maybe threads should be a part of instagram instead of being a complete seperate app.. Just like how reels are a part, threads should also be a part of instagram. That would be nice and easier.",3
399,2023-07-11,"It has minimal UI and a typical user flow. There is a bug, though. When I try to upload images in the following thread, it shuts. I tried removing from recents, reinstalled, but stayed the same.",3
400,2023-07-12,"Not bad for an initial launch. Looking forward to future versions, and hopefully a web interface that allows posting. Needs a lot of work, but will probably exceed Twitter's features and eventually popularity.",4
401,2023-07-06,This Applications interface is shuttering when I use to refresh the page and also it don't responded as I can expect. I thing it needs to improve their interfacen !! Yes I was very excited to use this app but it didn't work in my phone. Is it running fine with your device ?,1
402,2023-07-07,"Lot of space to improve. Would love to have a much more advanced options to post a thread (text styling etc.), and a view that seperate people you follow and fyp. Need the save image and video button. Need the time mark in video player. Just experienced crashing when I go beyond a reply to a reply in a thread, hope yall will fix that ASAP. Need save button, hashtags and embed. For messages just link insta... Please don't seperate it. Need the option to choose what we see from a person we follow.",3
403,2023-07-07,"Writing after day 1, it's about as smooth a launch as it could've hoped for. I am however having a problem where if I search for users too much (as one looking for accounts to follow will do), the search breaks and doesn't fix itself. I'm not sure whether this is a bug or a rate limit. It fixed after reinstallation but only once. I hope and expect more features will be added to the app in short order, too. E.g. DMs, customized account lists, Web version. Default home feed should be different.",5
404,2023-07-07,I feel like there's room for more features. Like the dark and light mode. One should be able to save pictures and also choose whether to auto play videos or not,3
405,2023-07-06,"Threads needs a search feature for content. The search bar only searches for accounts. People should be able to use the search bar to find thread topics. If you want to see what's being said about a show or person, you should be able to search keywords to pull content related to your search. The app feels unusable without that simple feature.",2
406,2023-07-06,"There's no option to disable Reels or videos autoplay on the app. This is the major reason why I don't use Instagram, its parent app. Too many unnecessary Reels or videos will consume a lot of data. I thought this would be different from Instagram, but it's all the same. I hate the autoplay.",1
407,2023-07-11,"It's more like Facebook, in my opinion, but it doesn't allow for hashtags or topic searches. I prefer Twitter, most def. I want to delete it, but the app does not allow account deletion without also deleting my Instagram. Not happy with the app at all, really.",2
408,2023-07-07,"Cool interface. Nice idea. However, I'm unable to browse different locations in my phone to add a photo or video to my post. This is significant issue and a turn off",3
409,2023-07-07,"Sorry only two stars however gotta admit the app has huge potential but you need to do two things, first get rid of the annoying celebrities and influencers and brands that i don't follow nor any of the people on my following list interacted with from my timeline, second you need to disconnect the app from instagram or at least make the link between the two optional.",2
410,2023-07-13,"The size of the application is huge. There is also no data saving mode with it, We can't stop autoplay videos. Get the lite version of this application as soon as possible.",1
411,2023-07-08,"I like it, but the content us not sorted chronologically, so I keep seeing posts from two days ago mixed with more recent posts. Also, lots of post from corporations, celebrities and influencers keep being shown in the timeline (if we can call it like that), so I spend all my time muting and blocking, because those marketing agency contents are annoying to see.",4
412,2023-07-08,"I am a big fan of this application. I've been getting tired of all the changes Elon has done to twitter. There is still a very steep growth curve, but im very excited. There are two features that I feel like would be really helpful to improve user experience. 1) as im writing my threads, if I exceed the number of threads my screen allows, I am unable to scroll down to see what im writing as my keyboard is blocking the view, and threads doesn't allow to scroll down. 2) threads scheduler!",4
413,2023-07-06,"Good start, needs a lot of work. It is a good start but is missing basic features like; DMs, following feed, dark mode. It is also a bit slow to load.",3
414,2023-07-08,"When I log into Threads, I automatically log out from Instagram and vice versa. There is no option to see posts only from accounts I follow. There is no option for posts that I am NOT INTERESTED in. It is new, and people like new things, but let me just say it, there is a huge need for improvement.",2
415,2023-07-10,"Keeps closing when typing. I'm using a Huawei P30 and it just closes when typing, more often when typing @ then a name but it's mega frustrating. I'm giving it a 3 because of this. Otherwise it's a fantastic new app and the absence of DMs is an absolute winner and game changer.",3
416,2023-07-06,"The amount of data this app requires from users is absurd. And the fact that you can't delete your threads account without deleting your instagram is horrible! The app itself is mainly text. If you're joining as a Twitter alternative, don't bother. You can't even search posts. There are no hashtags. I already want to delete threads just because of the extreme data mining. Europe has blocked it for those exact reasons.",1
417,2023-07-14,"Lacks a lot of features so here's some feedback: Add a trending page in there. Make it so that the followers and following can be accessed separately, like on IG. Allow people to have different usernames from their IG handles. When there's a bunch of images, show them in a collage instead of showing one big image and then scrolling to the others like in IG. Also, let people zoom into pics without the images resizing themselves automatically. Don't compress images. Make it different from IG.",2
418,2023-07-18,Draining the battery and the app is missing a lot of features. They force you to use Instagram account for using the app. If I want to delete the account for Threads then I have to delete my Instagram account too. Please read details of the app it may collect before U download because they collect too much sensitive informations like financial and health also others details. The app working poorly because it keeps crashing when trying to post or comment and login push notification keep lagging.,1
419,2023-07-06,"This app would've been a better version of Twitter but if one wants to delete the account, they need to delete their Instagram too. This is the worst implemention a company could have brought. Deactivating does not include your Instagram but still, you should be able to delete your account without deleting Instagram! At least this information needs to be in the registiration page OR the description of the app.",1
420,2023-07-12,"Great app with lots of potential. The app's social features are also fantastic. I can connect with friends who are also using Thread's, create groups, and even send direct invites to plan lunch dates. It's a great way to stay connected and coordinate lunch outings with ease.",5
421,2023-07-10,One thing this app is good and it's on time where we'll get to see latest things more than Twitter. But one thing keeps me annoyed is that whenever I'm scrolling and a video pops out I always have to unmute and next video comes I still have to unmute like I just can't stop doing that. So that's the only problem I'm facing with this app so if that's fixed by next update I'm sure I'm gonna put 5 stars on that,4
422,2023-07-09,"Everything else is OK , but When you go to gallery you have no option for going to your photo albums. If I have 500 photos in my gallery I have to scroll through every photo in my gallery to get the particular one. I think there should be an option for getting access to your photo albums in attachment.",4

Sometimes while leaving a thread of my own or commenting on someone else', I'll be randomly kicked out, as if I touched my minimize button, (which I haven't) & it's gone out of the post I was in & cleared what I typed. Most times I would loose the post completely... You can imagine how frustrating this is! 10 July, I had to re-type my own thread 4 times, as I kept being kicked out",2
424,2023-07-06,"I want my video muted for private reasons and i hope insta/meta devs can make it slightly bigger so that i avoid pressing the video when pressing the unmute button, i hate it when it happens becoz the video gets enlarge, i like the auto play feature while scrolling, the mute/unmute button is just my problem. So i rate it 4/5, so far so good it feels like a new home, a new space to breath, new people to meet, internet feels new again. Thank you Instagram! Thank you Meta!",4
425,2023-07-18,"I am not impressed. The app should have been separated from IG. Any restriction on one should never have to affect the other. Again, the whole idea of not having access to one's followers list at some point is annoying. Can we have a tab to mass-unfollow everyone who isn't following back. I need my time line to be filled with contents I choose to see from followers. It crashes a lot too.",2
426,2023-07-06,"Definitely still enjoying this low stress and low drama experience on day 2. It has room to grow and improve, and a rollout of new features will help to retain users, but for something in its infancy, it's pretty great.",5
427,2023-07-07,"It's okay. But I hope it has an option to simply switch account. Just like in IG where I can just double tap the profile icon then it switches. In threads, I need to logout first then switch account which is quite frustrating.",3
428,2023-07-07,"I like the app, however there are some glitches and recommendations I have. For one, the reply function seems to be finicky, it on occasion force shuts down the app when I am trying to reply to a post (a thread?). Another recommendation is discoverability, I would love a tab where you can discover new people and what they're saying. Like a community or discover page, also a trending tab with news and the sorts would boost engagement.",4

430,2023-07-11,"Great app... but some things need fixing. The app crashes anytime I try to upload a photo, probably 10mb or higher. Plus, the quite disorganised feed. Asides that great app and competition for Twitter",2
431,2023-07-14,"I like the simplicity and the focus on conversation. Plus, no ads yet, which is why I gets 5 stars. There's no clear organization of threads. I like the panorama photo presentation, too, it's slick. Threads can't take credit for the quality of users, but I'm rather enjoying the pleasant and kind people I see on there.",5

433,2023-07-07,"I used to be a user few months ago and this was just like messenger. When I downloaded this again today, I hoped they would've saved the messaging option. It's a good app for the rivalry but I didn't expect them to completely remove the originality of the app. I hope the future updates of this app will consist a mixture of the old threads and the new one so we can DM the people along w this new sick update. Until then, I'll be using old version of this app just for my DMs lol.",3
434,2023-07-07,While typing out a post or reply the app force closes with no error message. And when it does this it has no temporary memory to start where you left off. Rather frusting if you plan on posting rather than scrolling,2
435,2023-07-24,Not too bad so far it feels a little barren in comparison to some other websites and apps but it has potential The quality control and filtering need some work And i'd like more control over the timeline of stuff I see but it's a start,2

You can share photos, videos, messages, and stories with your chosen group of people in a fast and fun way.

439,2023-07-08,The only thing that's keeping me from giving this app Five stars is the fact that I can't post uncompressed photos that are larger than 10mbs at a rough guess. If I try to the app crashes or fails to post the image which is really disappointing,4
440,2023-07-06,"Wow, I am absolutely blown away by the Instagram Thread app! It has revolutionized the way I communicate and share content with my friends and followers on Instagram. The app's interface is sleek, intuitive, and user-friendly, making it incredibly easy to create and manage threaded conversations. One of my favorite features of the app is the ability to organize my comments and replies into threads.",5

Also changing your username or name in general... you have to do it via Instagram. I would love to try the App out, but considering that I always have separate accounts accross different Social Medias, I have to wait, until Meta decides to review this issue, in which Im apparently not the only one.",1
442,2023-07-14,"Pretty Solid App. Wish it didn't show me threads from people I don't follow, and an easier way to find people and subjects through searching. Very fun and simple to use. Surprisingly well managed and appropriate.",5
443,2023-07-06,There are many problems which I want to address. 1) No themed icon support on Android 2) you can't insert from clipboard if its an image. 3) you can't add gifs and only thing you can add is attachments and that opens gallery. 4) username can't be distinct from Instagram. I use Instagram and Twitter for different audiences so it doesn't help. 5)App doesn't support 60 fps video upload. 6) No button to jump to DM with any one.,1
444,2023-07-10,"The developers have already said that this app is a work in progress. Let's hope it gets better than Twitter and simplifies text based posts. At the current stage, the user interface is easy and beautiful. A lot of famous Twitter profiles have already moved to Threads, so it's not lonely here. The biggest issue is that you see posts from accounts that you never followed! It's very very annoying.",5

446,2023-07-22,"This app doesn't even have good features! It just got fame due to Twitter's outage. App UI is horrible! Doesn't even have stuff to do in here. Only good thing is that it uses your Instagram ID as login and you have the option to follow all the people you followed in Instagram, that's a neat feature! APP WILL DIE WITHIN 6 MONTHS!",2

449,2023-07-08,I love the interface but my issue with this app is that almost all of the content I see in my timeline are from accounts I don't follow. I would really love it if the next update would give you an option to have your followings as the only posts you see in your timeline.,3
450,2023-07-06,"Good app, still needs more features. For a base app that only released 1-2 days ago, it is pretty good. But there is a lack of features, such as polls. Although I'm sure they'll be adding that stuff later. Overall high quality and engaging app!",4
451,2023-07-07,"Objectively better than the alternatives. It's really that simple. Mastodon was ok but everyone left. Twitter was great before it turned into a barely functional sewer fire.

460,2023-07-09,It's good but it have four problems 1) like instagram it doesn't have the feature to login many accounts at same time. 2) it doesn't have dark mode. 3) it doesn't have the feature to translate bio. 4) There is no edit thread option.,3

It'd be usable if we could limit main feed posts to only the ones who we follow and then a separate explore/Activity section.",1
466,2023-07-21,I Want To Like it! I just find it really annoying that I keep seeing posts from people I don't follow or things I'm not interested in on my feed MORE than posts from the people I do follow and actually want to see and I have no way of stopping it from showing up. It has potential to be such a good app.,3
467,2023-07-22,"Really pathetic app, can't even share my YouTube video link properly only link showsup and the thumbnail doesn't. I was showing up a couple days ago but now it's just the link. They should sync the facebook link debugger for threads as well.",1
468,2023-07-08,"For some reason, this app needs access to the following information from your phone: Personal info (even though you'd be providing that yourself) Financial info (excuse me, what?) Health and fitness info (Why?) Messages (Emails, sms, etc) Photos and videos (I suppose it needs access when you want to upload) Files and docs (can you upload files and documents?)

471,2023-07-06,"So far my time on threads have been satisfactory. But this bad boy needs more features. Editing posts, saving photos posts, use of hashtags, direct messages, monetization, third party app linkage, logging without Instagram, and that's all I can say for now.",4
472,2023-07-23,So I tried getting onto the app today and it wouldn't let me and instead made me have to do an appeal with verification to prove its me. I submitted it and they just put a message saying thanks and to wait until the appeal is finished being reviewed to see whether or not I can regain access to my account. Says if they find its not me that it will be permanently disabled which is bs! Hope they fix this and let me back on my account!,1
473,2023-07-06,"After 7-8 hours, I gave up. It's a lonely place if you're arriving blind without existing Instagram followers. A default feed full of influencers I can't relate to and if it's possible to search for posted content that interests me, I can't figure it out. I'll check back in a few months when it's more mature. Uninstalling for now.",2
474,2023-07-07,Very annoying that the first time you try to confirm your mobile number you are issued with an alpha numeric code and yet can only enter numeric on your phone!!!!!!! Made me want to uninstall right away. Issue codes that actually work. Plus bcos im on hols issuing the text to my UK number in another language. Very irritating.,1
475,2023-07-07,"App keeps crashing whenever I try to upload a pic. Also, had a lot of notifications for follow requests. However, after individually accepting a couple, the rest of them disappear. :/",1
476,2023-07-07,"I love the potential of this app and can see myself use it more, but the only way that's happening is if my feed only shows me accounts I follow rather than having somewhat of an explore page on my feed. It's really content and information overload and we already have that with Instagram unfortunately - I don't think I can handle more without deleting one or the other. Please no ads or random algorithms, just a chronological feed of accounts I follow. Also surprised how hashtags don't work here?",2
477,2023-07-24,I had high hopes for this app. Unfortunately there is way too many bugs that makes the user experience poor. Threads is also lacking on lots of features that Twitter currently has. The censorship and invasive data collection is also a big downside. The marketing made me believe threads would rival Twitter but I just don't see that happening. Threads needs a big revamping in order to actually compete with Twitter.,1
478,2023-07-08,Has great potential. Just needs an option to only display feeds you follow and an option for chronological order. Those would definitely make it an amazing app.,4
479,2023-07-19,"at first I like it but I started having a problem. It keeps closing. I'm not even done composing my caption. I couldn't upload the photos that I wanted to post because it keeps on stopping. I refresh it, I log out and went online, I redownload the app but still I couldn't post what I wanted to post :<",2
480,2023-07-14,"For the devs, here are pointers on how you can improve the app: 1. Allow users to save pictures. 2. Only censor porn on profiles below 18. 3. Have a translation feature. 4. Do not repeat the same mistake as Twitter where accounts that the users aren't following are appearing on their feed. If y'all just wanna make a Twitter ripoff, at least make it a better version from the very start.",3
481,2023-07-19,"This is very similar to the bird app, but without the rampant toxicity. It works well enough, but it does feel a bit light on features. Hopefully it will become better with time. Overall, I am really enjoying Threads.",5
482,2023-07-08,I really like it!! Though I have a suggestion that could really help a lot of us users. Please add another option for following where we could only see the threads of the person we follow. I really don't like my feed as it's really messy and too much people I don't follow. I wasn't really interested at all. Plus it's also hard to see my peeps threads because of those unnecessary threads at all.,5
483,2023-07-11,"A subpar Twitter with less features, inability to save/share photos, and already being overrun by spam bots. Like it's been up for so little time, one would think they would have pulled all the kinks for fighting spam from their instagram, but no.",1

488,2023-07-09,I like the app very much but if you think it is going to replace Twitter keep dreaming it may be in a mess right now but it is not as tuff as Facebook if you like to add certain content that is for adults that is why Twitter is not going anywhere soon plus you need to fix it so does not use a lot of battery power in the background when it is not being used,4
489,2023-07-19,"It's pretty ok so far. If it gets better in later updates I MIGHT move from Twitter. Off the top of my head a few improvements you can make is adding a timeline for accounts you follow & let us make other customizable timelines, adding post search would be amazing. Normally I don't like Meta/Facebook products but honestly? As an artist I just want to get out of Twitter and still have a chance getting seen.",4
490,2023-07-08,"Pretty good for first attempt. Needs some fixing and features. How about ""lists"" so I can sort who or what I'm following by genre or topic? I would like to be able to read sports info separately from entertainment info. Easier to follow people that way.",3
491,2023-07-22,"Past few days, if I try to share a link to an article, instead of it looking like it should, with a preview image & headline, all that shows up is a truncated URL.",2
492,2023-07-06,"I really like the UI. I have never used Twitter(i do have a ac) coz most people I know don't use it. But since this is a part of Instagram most would start one. It would be really helpful if I could switch between different accounts just like in Instagram. It's a hassle to everytime log out, confirm the login and use the other account.",3
493,2023-07-07,"To best honest Threads is fat better than other social media . I didn't notice anything wrong there but one thing I've noticed that there is a same problem like Elon's Twitter , after posting anything we can't edit that & it was so much disappointing for me . When i was opening the account i thought there should be available that feature bt Alas! So you should add that feature.",4
494,2023-07-09,"Meh. With nothing explicit really allowed, it's just Instagram with a more text-based UI. What's the point if it's just Instagram with a different look? Also, a translate feature would be nice.",2
495,2023-07-12,"It has a lot of potential, I feel that its missing a few features such as a following/suggestions option on the FYP. an easier setup for being able to see and read replys, I find it difficult to see the replys for a specific post. Another feature I would recommend is a like count on the account page.",4
496,2023-07-06,"No dark mode toggle. No alt text. No DMs. One main feed with public mixed in. No pinned posts. App feels very simple and basic with bare bones, which is less than most startups have had. This app is unusable.",2
497,2023-07-06,"The app seems ok, but I don't intend to use it until I can limit my feed to people I follow. I don't want to see all that random content, it's mind numbing. Apparently this feature is ""on the list"". I'll take another look when it's done.",3
498,2023-07-08,This app is not user friendly and it's tough to understand the app structure and home page options but and also there are a lot of bugs. I hope you'll fix all the problems in next apdate.,1
499,2023-07-07,"This is an Amazing app! I like how it performs, it's buttery-smooth and so fast, I wish they add couple of features to the future updates such as a following page, being able to edit Threads and DMs would be great. But overall it's a great social media app and I'm enjoying it right now.",5
